/**
 * x402 paywall — the first real revenue rail.
 *
 * GET /api/agents/:id/report (the full underwritten credit report) costs
 * $0.01 in USDC per request, paid machine-to-machine over the x402
 * protocol (HTTP 402 + X-PAYMENT header, Linux Foundation standard). This
 * is the "pay-per-query credit check" business model wired up for real:
 * an agent that wants another agent's credit report pays for it, no
 * account, no API key, one HTTP roundtrip.
 *
 * Payment settles via the public x402 facilitator, on the network that
 * matches ONCHAIN_CHAIN — see lib/x402-network.ts.
 *
 * This used to be the literal 'base-sepolia' on every route, justified as the
 * payment rail being "deliberately independent of ONCHAIN_CHAIN, because the
 * payment rail doesn't need to live where the credit contracts live." True of
 * a credit report, which is a data sale. Not true of the two routes that FUND
 * ESCROW: on a Base mainnet deployment they answered a faucet token that costs
 * nothing to mint with real Circle USDC locked in a real escrow. Every guard
 * on those routes bounds how MUCH; none of them checked WHAT.
 *
 * Fully optional, same convention as the rest of the on-chain layer:
 * without X402_PAY_TO set, the paywall disappears and the report is free.

/**
 * Which paths the middleware actually RUNS on.
 *
 * This list and the price map above are two halves of one paywall, and for
 * the whole life of the storefront feature they disagreed: the map priced
 * `POST /api/storefront/<template>/commission`, and this matcher did not
 * include it, so Next never invoked the middleware on that path and the
 * route served for free. A POST with a valid scope and no `X-PAYMENT`
 * header at all came back `{"status":"commissioned"}` — a full escrowed
 * office pipeline, fronted from the prime's own wallet, given away.
 *
 * Nothing surfaced it because both halves looked right in isolation: the
 * price map names every template and is pinned by test against
 * storefront-pricing.ts, and the matcher is three plausible entries. The
 * bug lives only in their relationship. tests/x402-paywall-coverage.test.ts
 * now asserts that every priced route is covered here — see
 * docs/failure-modes.md §43.
 *
 * Next requires this to be statically analyzable, so it stays a literal
 * rather than being derived from STOREFRONT_COMMISSIONS; the test is what
 * keeps the literal honest.
