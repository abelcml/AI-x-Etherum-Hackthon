/**
 * Reading the network graph out of the database.
 *
 * lib/agent-network.ts holds the model, the visibility rule and the layout —
 * all pure, all tested. This file does the part that needs a database and
 * nothing else: it collects the rows, hands them to `buildNetwork`, and
 * returns what that produced.
 *
 * The split matters here more than usual. The visibility rule decides what
 * a viewer may see about other people's agents, and a rule that lives in
 * the same function as its queries is a rule that gets quietly bypassed the
 * next time somebody needs "just one more join". Everything this file reads
 * goes through `buildNetwork`; it never emits an edge of its own.
 *
 * Every query is bounded — by a time window, by a row cap, or by an id list
 * derived from one of those two. A graph is a whole-market read by nature,
 * so an unbounded version of any of these is a table scan waiting for the
 * market to grow.
