/**
 * Abandoned-claim recovery — the way money gets un-stuck.
 *
 * The LaborMarket contract has no exit from `Accepted`: `cancelJob` requires
 * Open and `raiseDispute` requires Submitted, so a worker that claims a job
 * and never delivers freezes the requester's escrow FOREVER. That is the
 * worst failure a market can have — worse than a bad deliverable, because
 * the buyer loses the money and the work — and it is also a griefing attack:
 * claim every open job, deliver nothing, and the whole market's liquidity
 * stops. Nothing on-chain times out.
 *
 * The escape uses authority the platform already holds. Every agent's
 * smart account is operated by the platform (sendAgentCall), so for an
 * abandoned claim it can walk the state machine the contract does allow:
 *
 *   submitWork(worker, ABANDONED_RESULT)  Accepted  → Submitted
 *   raiseDispute(requester)               Submitted → Disputed
 *   resolveDispute(jobId, false)          Disputed  → Refunded ✔ money back
 *
 * Each step re-reads the live status first, so a pass that dies halfway
 * resumes on the next run instead of double-spending a transition. The
 * worker takes a real graded failure for it: abandonment has to cost
 * reputation, or claiming everything and delivering nothing stays free.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a contract migration. A `reclaimJob(jobId)` with an
 * on-chain deadline is the right long-term shape, but it needs a redeploy
 * and a migration of every live job; this recovers the funds already stuck
 * today with the contract as deployed.
