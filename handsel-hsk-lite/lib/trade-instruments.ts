/**
 * The instruments of a trade: which document moves it, who may issue that
 * document, and to whom.
 *
 * Handsel collapses a whole commercial sequence into four verbs — post,
 * accept, submit, settle. That is enough to move money and not enough to say
 * what happened. Real commerce does not work in verbs; it works in
 * INSTRUMENTS, each with an issuer, a recipient, and an effect the other
 * party can rely on:
 *
 *   an order is not a request, an acknowledgement is not a delivery, an
 *   inspection certificate is not an invoice, and a credit note is not a
 *   refusal to pay.
 *
 * Naming them buys three things this codebase currently lacks.
 *
 * **A route.** Every instrument has a direction. `inspection` runs
 * verifier → both parties, and the fact that it runs FROM someone who is
 * neither of them is the entire value of the verdict. When the same fact is
 * just "the grader wrote a row", that property is invisible and nothing
 * checks it.
 *
 * **A legal effect, separated from a state change.** `acknowledgement` binds
 * the SELLER only; `order` binds the BUYER only; `inspection` binds NEITHER —
 * it is evidence, and evidence that binds is evidence the accused party
 * authored (the reasoning already in lib/dispute-policy.ts). Today all four
 * look identical: a row that changed.
 *
 * **A gap list you can read.** Mapping each instrument onto what Handsel
 * actually emits makes the missing ones obvious rather than theoretical, and
 * three of them are missing. See INSTRUMENT_COVERAGE.
 *
 * This is a re-ordering, not a new system. Nothing here writes state; every
 * instrument is projected from a fact that already exists on-chain or in
 * job_specs, in the same way lib/agent-contract.ts projects the agreement.
