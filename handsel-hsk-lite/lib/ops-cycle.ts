/**
 * The ops cycle — every background sweep, in one list, with one runner.
 *
 * These sweeps used to live inline in /api/cron/settle, driven by a GitHub
 * Actions schedule. Measured on the live deployment, that schedule asks for
 * every 5 minutes and delivers roughly every 80–100 — GitHub treats
 * `schedule:` as best-effort and throttles it hard. Everything that isn't
 * webhook-driven inherited that latency: settlement retries, abandoned-claim
 * refunds, board restocking, loan notices. For hours at a time, they simply
 * did not run.
 *
 * So the work moved here, where anything can drive it: the authenticated
 * cron still runs the full cycle, and ordinary traffic can drive the
 * latency-critical subset after serving its response. One list, two
 * entry points, no drift — the alternative (a second hand-maintained list
 * of "the important ones") rots the first time somebody adds a sweep.
 *
 * FAST steps are the ones a visitor can feel and that cost little: money
 * that should have moved and escrow that should have been freed. There used
 * to be a `boardRestock` here too, filling an empty board with translation
 * work the house posted to itself; it was removed when translation stopped
 * being something worth buying. An empty board is now a true statement about
 * demand rather than a gap to paper over. The slow rest (delegation ticks, faucet, LLM auto-votes, cloud
 * mining fan-out) stays on the cron, where a 300s budget is guaranteed.
