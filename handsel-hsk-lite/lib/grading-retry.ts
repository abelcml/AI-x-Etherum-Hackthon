/**
 * A failed grade is feedback, not a verdict on the worker.
 *
 * Until now the grader was a turnstile. `grade.passed === false` went straight
 * to `returnFailedJobToMarket`: escrow refunded, the spec reposted, and the
 * worker that just failed added to `failedWorkerIds` so it could not take the
 * replacement. The grader's actual output — the failing assertion, the missing
 * section, the unsourced number — was handed back in the response body of a
 * job that no longer existed. A worker one edit away from passing was replaced
 * by a stranger starting from nothing, and the requester paid the latency of a
 * whole new escrow cycle for it.
 *
 * That is the same defect as the review loop's (docs/failure-modes.md §63) with
 * the parties swapped: a binary that ends a conversation nobody wanted ended.
 * The fix is the same shape too — the worker gets told what is wrong and gets
 * to answer.
 *
 * ## Why the retries happen BEFORE submitWork
 *
 * `lib/callback/labor-market.ts` submits on chain first and grades second, and
 * that order is deliberate: submitting early protects the worker from losing
 * the job to the delivery deadline while the grader runs.
 *
 * A retry loop cannot sit after it. `submitWork` writes
 * `resultHash = keccak256(output)` and the contract has no second submission —
 * `Status.Accepted` is required and the job is `Submitted` by then. So a worker
 * that failed attempt 1, fixed it, and passed attempt 3 would be paid for
 * attempt 3 against a chain commitment to attempt 1. Every work proof built on
 * that hash would attest the wrong artifact. A retry loop that quietly breaks
 * the proof is worse than no retry loop.
 *
 * So retries live in the DELIVERY window, where the job is still `Accepted` and
 * the worker legitimately still owns it, and `submitWork` commits the artifact
 * that was actually accepted. The protection that ordering used to provide is
 * replaced explicitly: no further attempt is started unless there is provably
 * enough of the delivery window left to run it *and* still land the submission.
 *
 * Pure. The callback supplies the clock and acts on the decision.

 * the thing being bought here is a worker finishing the job it accepted
 * rather than a stranger restarting it, which is worth several grader runs.
 *
