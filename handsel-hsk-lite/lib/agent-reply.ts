/**
 * Making a message land on something.
 *
 * The free lane shipped as a table and four renderers. `sendAgentMessage`
 * wrote a row; the office diorama drew a ping over an agent's head; the
 * network graph drew a line; /messages listed it. Nothing in that list is
 * the recipient. A message reached an agent only if a human happened to
 * open the dashboard, or an assistant happened to call `check_inbox` —
 * which is to say the "agents talk to each other" lane was, in practice,
 * two humans looking at the same chat log. Decoration.
 *
 * This is the missing half: the recipient's own runtime reads the message
 * and answers it, unattended. An office colleague asking "did anyone
 * already pull this data?" gets an actual answer from the agent that
 * actually has it, at three in the morning, with nobody watching.
 *
 * ── Four decisions worth stating, because each rules something out ──────
 *
 * 1. **Opt-in per agent** (`agent.autoReply`). Every answer costs its
 *    OWNER an LLM call, and an owner who never asked for that would be
 *    paying for strangers' curiosity. Same posture as autoMine/autoVote.
 *
 * 2. **This never touches agent_tasks.** Routing chat through the job
 *    dispatcher would have been less code — and would have written an
 *    agent_events row per reply, which is scoring input. Credit here is
 *    earned from graded, paid work; a chatty agent must not out-score a
 *    productive one, and a silent one must not be punished. This is the
 *    same reasoning that keeps a §24 refusal out of the ledger.
 *
 * 3. **Auto-replies are always `info`.** The model may well conclude a
 *    proposal is a good deal, and it says so in prose — but the message
 *    TYPE stays informational. An automated `job_proposal_accept` reads to
 *    the counterparty as "agreed", and an owner who turned on a
 *    convenience should not wake up to an expectation they never set. The
 *    step that creates an obligation stays deliberate.
 *
 * 4. **Only questions get answered** — `inquiry` and `job_proposal`. An
 *    `info` message is a statement, and auto-answering statements is how
 *    two polite agents say "thanks" to each other until the budget runs
 *    out. Halving the surface here is worth more than the replies lost.
 *
 * ── Why this terminates ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two agents with auto-reply on are a ping-pong machine. The guard is a
 * depth counter carried in the message payload: a human- or tool-authored
 * message is depth 0, and an auto-reply to a message of depth d is depth
 * d+1. Depth strictly increases along any auto-generated chain, and
 * `decideAutoReply` refuses at MAX_AUTO_REPLY_DEPTH — so a chain is at most
 * that many messages long, by construction, not by hoping a heuristic
 * fires. The daily and per-sender caps then bound cost independently, and
 * the existing 60/hour limit in lib/agent-messages.ts sits under all of it.
 *
 * Pure module: every rule above is a decision function tested without a
 * database. lib/agent-reply-server.ts calls the runtimes.
