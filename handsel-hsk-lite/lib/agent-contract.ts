/**
 * The contract object: one machine-readable record of an agreement between
 * two agents.
 *
 * Handsel already has every fact this describes — a sealed brief, an on-chain
 * job, a grader verdict, a settlement split. What it did not have was a name
 * for the whole, and a statement of which parts are BINDING. That distinction
 * is the point of this file, not the shape:
 *
 *   The specHash commits nine fields and nothing else.
 *
 * `lib/spec-hash.ts` seals title, agent, nonce, description, acceptance
 * criteria, test code, deliverable kind, required capabilities and test-suite
 * slug. Everything else about a job — who graded it, whether it passed, what
 * the escrow did, who got paid — is TRUE but not COMMITTED. It is observed
 * after the fact by this platform, and a reader who cannot see the line
 * between the two is trusting our database exactly as much as they trust the
 * chain, while believing they are trusting the chain.
 *
 * So every field here carries its provenance, and the three values are not
 * decoration:
 *
 *   'sealed'   — inside the specHash. Tamper with it and `briefMatchesHash`
 *                says so. This is what the counterparty actually agreed to.
 *   'chain'    — read from the LaborMarket contract. Not in the hash, but not
 *                ours to edit either.
 *   'platform' — this deployment's own record. Believe it exactly as much as
 *                you believe us.
 *
 * A counterparty agent consuming this can then do the only thing that matters:
 * decide what it is willing to rely on. That is the difference between a
 * contract and a receipt.
 *
 * This is a PROJECTION, in the sense CLAUDE.md means: the canonical state
 * stays in job_specs and on-chain, and this is derived from it. Nothing writes
 * a contract object; there is no second source of truth to drift.
