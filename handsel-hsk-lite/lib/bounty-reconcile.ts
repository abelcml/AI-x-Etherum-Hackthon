/**
 * The sweep for a bounty whose issue is gone.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A labelled issue escrows money; removing the label or closing the issue is
 * supposed to give it back. That refund was **one webhook delivery**. It fires
 * once, GitHub does not redeliver a `closed` event because the handler
 * answered 200, and two of the handler's exits are silent:
 *
 *   - `specsForIssue` returns nothing  → `ignored`, no comment
 *   - `readJobsOrUnknown` returns null → `deferred`, no comment
 *
 * Job #327 hit the first one for a real reason (a repost had dropped its
 * `issue_number`, fixed separately). But the second needs no defect at all —
 * one RPC hiccup at the moment the issue closes produces the same stranded
 * escrow with every line of code behaving exactly as written. The handler's
 * own comment says it leaves the case "to the escrow sweeps." There were no
 * escrow sweeps for this. That sentence was the whole bug.
 *
 * Nothing on-chain rescues it either: `cancelJob` on an `Open` job is
 * requester-only, so none of LaborMarketV2's three permissionless timeouts
 * reach a job nobody ever claimed. The escrow is not frozen — the owner can
 * always cancel by hand — but nothing automatic ever notices, and "the owner
 * eventually notices" is not a mechanism.
 *
 * ## What it does
 *
 * Asks GitHub, for every Open bounty job, whether its issue still wants it.
 * Closed issue, or bounty label removed ⇒ cancel and refund.
 *
 * ## What it refuses to do
 *
 * Act on missing evidence. A GitHub read that fails is not a closed issue; a
 * chain read that fails is not an absent job. Both mean **do nothing and come
 * back** — this sweep spends the requester's money, and the failure it must
 * never have is cancelling a live bounty because an API was briefly down. That
 * is `docs/failure-modes.md` invariant 5, and §12 is what it looks like when
 * an empty result from a failed read gets treated as an empty world.
