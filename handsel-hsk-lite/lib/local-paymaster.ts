/**
 * A local paymaster: the account's own gas pool.
 *
 * A real ERC-4337 paymaster sponsors gas at the protocol level and needs a
 * deposit in the EntryPoint plus a signing service. This deployment has
 * neither, so every kernel account self-pays — and `ensureAgentGas`, the one
 * thing in this codebase that refills an empty agent, only runs in EOA mode
 * and spends the OPERATOR's ether. In kernel mode nothing refills anything:
 * an agent that runs out stops, permanently, until a human notices and sends
 * it ETH by hand.
 *
 * That is a smaller problem than it looks, because it does not need the
 * protocol. Every agent on an account belongs to one owner, and that owner can
 * hold ETH in one of their own agents. Sponsorship then is just a transfer
 * between two wallets the same person controls, sized to what the chain is
 * about to charge — which is exactly the shape lib/office-bond-cover.ts
 * already established for USDC bonds.
 *
 * So this is not "a paymaster we could not build". It is the part of one that
 * is actually load-bearing here: an agent that would have stopped keeps
 * working, out of a pool its owner filled on purpose.
 *
 * What makes it safe is that it is bounded in four independent ways, and the
 * bounds matter more than the mechanism:
 *
 *  1. **Opt-in and named.** Nothing is sponsored until the owner designates a
 *     source agent. No pool, no sponsorship — never "helpfully" drained from
 *     whichever wallet happened to have money.
 *  2. **A per-window budget.** Gas is needed for EVERY write, including work
 *     an agent claims from strangers, so unlike bond cover this cannot be
 *     gated on the job. The budget is the guard: an account can spend at most
 *     LOCAL_GAS_WINDOW_BUDGET_WEI a day on sponsorship, and a runaway
 *     auto-miner burns that and stops, not the wallet.
 *  3. **A reserve in the source.** The transfer is itself a UserOperation paid
 *     out of the pool's own balance; a pool drained to zero cannot fund
 *     anything, including its own rescue.
 *  4. **Recorded before it is sent.** Same discipline as every other spend
 *     here: a top-up that lands and is not recorded is one the budget hands
 *     out again.
