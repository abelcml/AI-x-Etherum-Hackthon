/**
 * Office connections — "visit someone else's office with a code."
 *
 * Each account gets one shareable code. Redeeming another account's code
 * connects the two — not a permission grant (the market is already
 * permissionless on-chain; `acceptJob` has no allowlist, and adding one would
 * mean a contract change, the same category of risk as H-03's fix, not
 * something a social feature earns) but a DISCOVERY relationship: which
 * offices show up in each other's "visit" view, and later, which review
 * subtasks get curated toward each other instead of the flat public board.
 *
 * That on-chain openness is separate from whether an office's OWN pipeline
 * work actually goes to the staff hired for it — see lib/job-reservation.ts,
 * which reserves a specific hired agent's job off-chain and is enforced by
 * every dispatch path this platform controls (claimJobSpec). It's a real
 * guarantee for normal use, just not a cryptographic one against a caller
 * who talks to the contract directly.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a new collusion-discount mechanism. Two connected offices
 * that only ever review each other are exactly the star topology
 * `lib/credit-engine/counterparty-graph.ts` already prices down — that graph
 * is built from real settled trades (JOB_COMPLETED events), not from an
 * explicit "these accounts are linked" table, so it catches this pattern
 * automatically as long as office-connected reviews flow through the same
 * job/event pipeline as any other job. This file adds no new scoring logic
 * on purpose.
 *
 * `OfficeBook` is the pure state machine (fully unit-testable, no randomness,
 * no DB). The exported functions back it with a self-migrating Postgres pair
 * of tables, same shape as `lib/claim-ticket.ts`.
