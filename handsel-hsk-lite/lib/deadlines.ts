/**
 * Who actually calls LaborMarketV2's permissionless exits.
 *
 * The contract grew four of them — `expireOpen`, `reclaimJob`, `expireReview`,
 * `expireDispute` — each with a deadline, each callable by a stranger, each
 * tested against a real EVM. Then a grep for their names across `lib/`, `app/`
 * and `sdk/` returned **nothing**. The same was true of `withdraw()`: settlement
 * credits rather than transfers, and no code drained a credited balance.
 *
 * "Permissionless" means anyone MAY call it. It does not mean anyone WILL. Two
 * rounds of audit established that the contract *can* do the right thing when
 * a deadline passes; this file is what makes something *do* it. Without it the
 * timeouts are a property of the bytecode and not of the product, and the money
 * they were built to free sits exactly as long as it did before they existed.
 *
 * ## Why the decision is a pure function
 *
 * `dueDeadlines` takes jobs and a clock and returns the calls to make. It
 * touches no chain, no database and no wall clock, which is the only reason the
 * boundary conditions below can be tested at all — every one of them is an
 * off-by-one against a timestamp, and the contract's own guards are `>=`.
 *
 * The mapping mirrors the contract exactly, and the tests assert that each of
 * the four money-holding states maps to exactly one function. Getting this
 * table wrong is not a missed sweep; it is calling `reclaimJob` on a job that
 * is owed to a worker.
 */

/** LaborMarketV2's `Status` enum, in its on-chain numeric order.
 *
 *  `Expired` is index 7 and V1's decoder had seven entries with a `?? 'Open'`
 *  fall-through — so under V1's table every timeout-settled job reads back as an
 *  OPEN JOB ON THE BOARD. That is harmless today only because the V1 ABI in
 *  `lib/onchain/config.ts` targets a contract with no `Expired` state at all;
 *  it becomes a live defect the moment an address points at V2. The guard test
 *  parses this list against the enum in the Solidity source, so appending a
 *  state to the contract without appending it here fails the build. */

 * Disputed jobs whose `disputeDeadline` is close enough to worry about, oldest

 * bounty and bond, whether or not the work was any good. `sweepDeadlines` will
 * call it the moment it is due — reliably, but that reliability is exactly the
 * problem: it guarantees the payout happens, not that it happens for the right
 * reason. Nothing between here and there checks whether the arbiter meant to
 * let it go.
 *
 * The realistic failure mode is not a sophisticated attacker pricing the
 * asymmetry (H-03, github.com/Kairose-master/handsel/issues/7) — it's a single
 * human arbiter with no backup missing a ruling because two weeks passed and
 * nobody was looking. That is an attention problem, not a contract bug, and it
 * does not need a redeploy to fix: it needs the same thing an approaching
 * deadline always needs, which is someone told before it is too late to matter.
 *
 * @param warnWithinSec how close to the deadline counts as "worth a heads-up".
 *                       Deliberately a parameter, not a constant: how much
 *                       warning is useful depends on how often whoever reads
 *                       this actually checks, which this module has no way to
