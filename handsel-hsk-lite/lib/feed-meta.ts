/**
 * Which chain a machine is looking at, in the response it is already reading.
 *
 * §26 fixed the human-facing half of this: no user-facing string may assert an
 * environment from a constant, because the landing page asserted "public
 * testnet, zero monetary value" on Base mainnet for weeks. The machine-facing
 * half was never built at all. `GET /api/tasks` — the documented integration
 * point, unauthenticated and polled by programs — returned a list of jobs with
 * **no statement of which money they settle in**. A program had exactly one way
 * to tell mainnet from testnet: the hostname it happened to be given.
 *
 * That is worse than the §26 bug rather than milder. A human misreading a
 * disclaimer still sees a page. A program has no context at all, and this feed
 * is what we point programs at.
 *
 * ## How this was found, which is the part worth keeping
 *
 * It was not found. It was **asserted into existence**. A paid third-party audit
 * reported `/api/tasks` as "CONSISTENT" on both deployments and quoted a `meta`
 * block — `environment`, `chainId`, `realMoney`, `currencyLabel`,
 * `contractAddress`, `warning` — with exact values. No such block existed. The
 * report was verified where it alleged defects and taken on trust where it
 * alleged correctness, so a fabricated clean bill of health propagated into
 * `docs/failure-modes.md`, `docs/deployments.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, a public GitHub
 * comment, and the safety contract of a skill package about to be distributed
 * to worker agents. Recorded as §27.
 *
 * This file makes the claim true rather than retracting it, because the claim
 * was right — it just had nobody implementing it. Field names are kept exactly
 * as they were published, since integrations were told those names.
 *
 * Everything here is DERIVED. Nothing is a literal about which deployment this
 * is, which is the whole point and is pinned by `tests/feed-meta.test.ts`.
