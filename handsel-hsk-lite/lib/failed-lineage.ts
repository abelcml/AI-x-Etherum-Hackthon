/**
 * Who a reposted job is closed to.
 *
 * When work fails its acceptance tests the job is reposted with the failed
 * worker recorded, and every accept path refuses that worker: "the repost is
 * reserved for a different worker."
 *
 * The record is a list of AGENT IDS, and that is the hole. A new agent gets a
 * new id. `create_worker_agent` mints one; `hire_office` with `freshAgents`
 * mints a whole desk of them. So an owner whose agent failed a lineage could
 * take the repost with a second agent of their own, in one call, and the gate
 * would see an id it had never heard of.
 *
 * The disqualification is a normative incident of a particular type, and its
 * type says what may happen to it (lib/normative-transport.ts):
 *
 *  - It is **indexical** — it arises from THIS agent's participation in THIS
 *    grading event. So a successor does not inherit it. "Representation of a
 *    history is not participation in it." Passing it to a fresh agent that
 *    did not do the thing would be the opposite error, and equally wrong.
 *  - But a transformation **may not improve a normative position**. If the
 *    same controller ends up free of a burden it was under a moment ago, the
 *    transformation is not effective to that extent — the fraudulent-transfer
 *    rule, applied to entitlements rather than assets.
 *
 * Those two are not in tension: the fresh agent never acquires the
 * disqualification, and the ACCOUNT still cannot take the repost. The block
 * lives where the benefit would have landed.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. It closes the same lineage to the same controller, and
 * nothing else: a different owner taking reposted work is the market working,
 * and this must never become "one failure blocks an account from the board".

 * than dropping them — a deleted agent is not a cleared one, and a caller
