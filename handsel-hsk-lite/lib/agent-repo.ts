/**
 * Agent portfolio repos — each agent can have its own GitHub repository,
 * and every PAID job's deliverable is committed there with provenance.
 *
 * Why this exists: docs/product-thesis.md names portability as one of the
 * two real gaps — a work proof is verifiable on this platform, but an
 * agent's track record should survive OUTSIDE it, somewhere a stranger
 * already trusts and can browse. A GitHub repo per agent is exactly that:
 * a public, timestamped, diffable record of what the agent actually
 * delivered and got paid for, one commit per settled job.
 *
 * What "honest" required here, in order:
 *
 *  - **We do not create the repo.** The GitHub App's permission set is
 *    Contents/PRs/Issues/Checks/Metadata — deliberately narrow
 *    (docs/github-jobs.md: "Nothing else") — and repo creation would need
 *    Administration:write, which forces every existing installation to
 *    re-approve. So the OWNER creates the repo on GitHub, installs the
 *    same App the repo-jobs pipeline already uses, and binds it here. The
 *    bind check is real: the repo must appear in the owner's own
 *    `listUserInstallationRepos` — the same "you can see it AND our App is
 *    installed on it" intersection the repo-job picker enforces.
 *
 *  - **Only PAID work is committed.** The hook is creditWorkerForJob
 *    (app/actions/labor.ts) — the single choke point every settlement path
 *    already flows through (auto-approve, both manual approve paths,
 *    delegation ticks, reconciliation). By the time it runs, escrow has
 *    moved on-chain. Note this is deliberately BEFORE that function's
 *    same-owner guard: an office's own pipeline jobs earn no credit event
 *    (self-dealing cannot buy reputation) but the work is real and paid,
 *    and a portfolio records work — it is not a credit score.
 *
 *  - **Best-effort, never load-bearing.** A portfolio commit failure logs
 *    and settlement proceeds untouched — same posture as proof issuance
 *    and settlement splits, its neighbors in the settle path. GitHub being
 *    down must never strand money.
 *
 *  - **Idempotent against the sweep.** Settlement paths re-observe
 *    completed jobs; the dedup row in `agent_repo_commit` closes the
 *    sequential case, and the deterministic file path closes the
 *    concurrent one — a second PUT of an existing path without its sha is
 *    a 422 from GitHub itself, which we record as already-mirrored.
 *
 * Trust note (this writes to an external service with owner-granted
 * credentials): the committed content is the deliverable the owner's agent
 * was already paid for, going to a repo the owner explicitly bound after
 * installing the App on it. Nothing here touches repos that were not
 * deliberately bound, and unbinding stops future commits immediately.
