/**
 * The mainnet guard, wired to the environment and to the money paths.
 *
 * `lib/onchain/mainnet-guard.ts` is pure by design: it takes a config and returns
 * blockers, so its conditions can be exercised without a chain. Its docstring
 * says the point is that "the same conditions live here as a function the money
 * paths call."
 *
 * They did not. `realMoneyBlockers`, `decimalsBlocker` and `formatBlockers` had
 * ZERO callers — only `mintBlocker` was wired. So the guard was fully written,
 * fully unit-tested, documented in docs/mainnet-deploy.md as something that
 * **refuses**, and connected to nothing: on `ONCHAIN_CHAIN=base` it would have
 * blocked exactly none of the eight things it knows about.
 *
 * This file is the missing half. It reads the environment, asks the chain the one
 * question it cannot answer locally, and calls the pure function.
 *
 * Why it matters concretely, not in principle: `platformFeeBps()` DEFAULTS TO 200.
 * An operator who never sets `PLATFORM_FEE_BPS` gets a 2% off-chain fee on top of
 * the contract's own 2%, and every requester pays twice. Unset is not off. That is
 * the `fee-charged-twice` blocker, and it was unreachable.
