/**
 * Agent account service — two interchangeable modes (config.agentAccountMode):
 *
 * 'kernel' — ZeroDev (ERC-4337 / Kernel) smart accounts. Each agent gets a
 * Kernel account derived deterministically from a single owner key plus a
 * per-agent index. Gas is sponsored by ZeroDev's paymaster. Requires the
 * chain to have live 4337 infra (bundler, paymaster, Kernel factory) —
 * true on Sepolia via ZERODEV_RPC.
 *
 * 'eoa' — plain per-agent EOAs, each derived deterministically from the same
 * single owner key (keccak of ownerKey ‖ agentId → private key). Used on
 * chains where 4337 infra isn't live yet (GIWA Sepolia as of 2026-07:
 * EntryPoint v0.7 exists as a predeploy, but no public bundler/paymaster and
 * no Kernel factory — verified via eth_getCode). Same one-key/N-agents
 * property and the same "the agent's own address transacts" semantics; gas
 * is auto-topped-up from the oracle account instead of sponsored.
 *
 * Both modes answer the same three calls: getAgentAccountAddress,
 * sendAgentCall, and (kernel-only, internal) getAgentKernel — so nothing
 * above this file knows which mode is active.
 *
 * Kernel mode targets @zerodev/sdk ^5.5 with EntryPoint v0.7 / Kernel v3.1.

 *
 * The attack is a sentence long: create agents, cause one send each, and every

 *
 * What makes it worse than the money: on the one-key deployment this project
 * chose, the oracle IS the arbiter. An oracle with no ETH cannot call
 * `resolveDispute`, so draining gas takes the market's only judge offline —
 * the same shape as the keeper-lane reserve in lib/gas-budget.ts, which exists
 * precisely so a gas attack cannot disable settlement.
 *
 * So it goes through the same fuse as every other sponsored call, with the same
 * two lanes. Exhaustion here cannot "degrade to self-pay" — an agent with no
 * ether has nothing to pay with — so it simply does not top up, and the send
 * that follows fails on its own terms. That is the honest outcome: the
 * operator's subsidy has a limit, and reaching it is not the same as the
