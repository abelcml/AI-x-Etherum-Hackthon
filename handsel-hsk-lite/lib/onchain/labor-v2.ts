 * LaborMarketV2's off-chain surface — the parts V1 never had.

 * timeout functions at all. Its seven-entry `JOB_STATUS` is CORRECT for that
 * contract. Nothing here changes it.
 *
 * What this file adds is everything V2 grew and nothing yet called: four
 * permissionless exits, a `jobs` getter with fourteen fields, an eighth status,
 * and pull payments. Kept separate rather than merged so that pointing at V2 is
 * a deliberate switch and not a silent reinterpretation of V1's data — a
 * fourteen-field decoder run against a seven-field contract does not fail
 * cleanly, it produces numbers.
