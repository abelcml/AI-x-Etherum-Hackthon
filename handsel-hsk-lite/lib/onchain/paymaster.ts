/**
 * Which paymaster sponsors, and the fact that it does not have to be ZeroDev's.
 *
 * The bundler and the paymaster are separate services that happened to arrive
 * behind one URL. `ZERODEV_RPC` is both, so when sponsorship stopped working the
 * apparent choice was to keep the account abstraction stack or lose gas
 * sponsorship — and those are not actually coupled. Paymaster communication is
 * ERC-7677 (`pm_getPaymasterStubData` / `pm_getPaymasterData`), viem ships a
 * generic client for it, and a Kernel account does not care who signs the
 * sponsorship.
 *
 * So the account stays Kernel v3.1, the bundler stays whatever `ZERODEV_RPC`
 * points at, and the paymaster becomes one env var. On Base the obvious
 * alternative is CDP's, which is on the same chain as the market.
 *
 * ## Order, and why it is this way round
 *
 * `PAYMASTER_DISABLED` wins over everything: it is the operator saying there is
 * no sponsorship, and a URL left in the environment must not quietly override
 * that. Then `PAYMASTER_RPC`, because configuring one explicitly is a deliberate
 * act. Then `ZERODEV_RPC`, which is where sponsorship lived before this file
 * existed and must keep working untouched for the testnet deployment.
 *
 * Nothing here validates the endpoint. `scripts/check-sponsorship.mjs` resolves
 * the same three variables in the same order and then asks it to sponsor
 * something, which is the only check that means anything — the lesson of a day
 * spent watching a paymaster that was configured, funded, and refusing.
