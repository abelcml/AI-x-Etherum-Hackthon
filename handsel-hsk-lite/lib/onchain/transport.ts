/**
 * The one place the chain RPC transport is built.
 *
 * Why this file exists: on 2026-08 the mainnet deployment's RPC failures were
 * measured from Vercel's error clusters — 212 of 212 were HTTP 429 from the
 * configured Base RPC, zero were timeouts. viem's default transport had
 * already retried each of those (retryCount 3 at 150ms base ≈ 150/300/600ms),
 * which is tuned for blips, not for a per-second rate limit that needs the
 * better part of a second to clear. And every `http(onchainEnv.rpcUrl)`
 * call site rebuilt its own transport with those defaults, so tuning meant
 * touching four files or none.
 *
 * Three levers, all aimed at 429:
 *
 * 1. **Batching** — independent reads issued in the same tick (the treasury
 *    pages fire one eth_getBalance + one balanceOf per agent, in parallel)
 *    coalesce into one JSON-RPC batch request. The provider may still meter
 *    the calls inside it, but the request-per-second limit — the one that was
 *    actually answering 429 — sees one request instead of N.
 * 2. **Slower, longer retry** — 400ms base doubling per attempt gives a
 *    rate-limited endpoint room to clear where 150ms re-hits it while it is
 *    still saying no.
 * 3. **Fallback URLs** — `ONCHAIN_RPC_FALLBACK_URLS` (comma-separated) names
 *    backup endpoints; when the primary's retries are exhausted the same
 *    request is answered by the next provider instead of failing the read.
 *    Unset, nothing changes: one URL builds a plain http transport.
 *
 * The bundler transport is deliberately NOT built here — a bundler holds
 * vendor-specific UserOperation state, so rotating providers mid-flight is
 * not the safe no-op it is for plain chain reads.
