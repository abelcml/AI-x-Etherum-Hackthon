/**
 * On-chain layer configuration — Base mainnet in production, Base Sepolia
 * for the V2 rehearsal, plus Ethereum Sepolia and GIWA Sepolia for earlier
 * deployments (see `docs/deployments.md` for which URL runs which chain).
 *
 * The whole on-chain layer is OPTIONAL and gated on these env vars — when
 * they're absent the app runs exactly as before (off-chain only). When set,
 * the credit engine mirrors each recalculated limit to the registry and
 * attests the score via EAS, and agents can draw/repay real (test) USDC
 * through their own on-chain accounts.
 *
 * Chain is selected with ONCHAIN_CHAIN ('sepolia' default | 'base' |
 * 'base-sepolia' | 'giwa-sepolia' | 'hsk-testnet' — see the CHAINS map below). Agent
 * accounts run in one of two modes (AGENT_ACCOUNT_MODE, auto-detected
 * from ZERODEV_RPC/BUNDLER_RPC when unset):
 *  - 'kernel': ERC-4337 Kernel smart accounts via ZeroDev — what mainnet runs.
 *  - 'eoa':    per-agent EOAs derived deterministically from the owner key —
 *              for chains where 4337 infra (bundler/paymaster/Kernel factory)
 *              isn't live yet, like GIWA Sepolia as of 2026-07. Same
 *              one-key/N-agents property, no bundler dependency.
