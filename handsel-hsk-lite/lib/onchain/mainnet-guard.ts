/**
 * The prerequisites for real money, as code rather than as a checklist.
 *
 * `docs/v2-plan.md` names what has to be true before this system touches a
 * chain where losing funds means losing funds. A document nobody re-reads on
 * deploy day is a document that gets skipped, so the same conditions live here
 * as a function the money paths call.
 *
 * Two design choices worth stating:
 *
 * **It refuses rather than warns.** A warning on a money path is a warning
 * that gets scrolled past. Every blocker below stops the operation.
 *
 * **It fails toward "this is real money".** An unrecognised chain counts as
 * real (see IS_REAL_MONEY), and a missing acknowledgement counts as
 * unacknowledged. Being wrong in that direction costs an operator two minutes
 * of confusion; being wrong the other way costs somebody's funds.
 *
 * Pure and unit-tested: it takes the config as an argument rather than reading
 * the environment, so the interesting cases can be exercised without a chain.
