/**
 * The Mail Desk — the storefront's email front door.
 *
 * The storefront (lib/office-storefront.ts) sells a whole office run to
 * anyone with an x402 client. This module opens the same engine to anyone
 * with an EMAIL ADDRESS: a buyer writes in, the desk quotes a price and a
 * deposit address, watches the chain for the payment, commissions the
 * office pipeline the moment it lands, and mails the finished deliverable
 * back. No account, no wallet connection on their side beyond sending USDC.
 * The "central office" this serves is not a new concept — it is whichever
 * storefront is open (the operator's standing desk); email is a second
 * client of it, not a second system.
 *
 * Three policies, each the answer to a way this could go wrong:
 *
 * 1. **Inbound-only. No cold outreach, ever.** Every email this desk sends
 *    is a reply to a person who wrote first, or a lifecycle notice on an
 *    order they placed — squarely inside lib/email.ts's stated transactional
 *    policy ("an inbox is someone else's attention and this platform bills
 *    itself on consent"). An automated cold-mailer is spam with extra steps,
 *    illegal in most jurisdictions (CAN-SPAM, 정보통신망법), and the fastest
 *    possible way to burn a sending domain.
 *
 * 2. **Email bodies are hostile input.** They reach an LLM only inside the
 *    same untrusted-content fence the grader uses, with a system prompt
 *    whose sole output is strict JSON — and the extracted scope then flows
 *    into the office pipeline, where the customer-task fence (the one every
 *    claim brief carries) guards the workers in turn. A mail that tries to
 *    instruct rather than order gets a catalogue reply, not obedience.
 *
 * 3. **The odd cents are the invoice.** One deposit address (the serving
 *    storefront prime's own) serves every order; each quote adds a unique
 *    cents amount so the incoming ERC-20 transfer's VALUE identifies which
 *    order paid. No per-order wallets to sweep, no payment reference a
 *    buyer can forget — the amount is the reference. Unattributable
 *    transfers are simply never matched: money nobody quoted stays visible
 *    in the prime's balance and is the operator's to reconcile by hand.
 *
 * Bounds, house style: per-sender and global open-quote caps, quotes expire,
 * the payment watcher scans bounded block ranges per tick, and every state
 * transition is a row the operator can read.
