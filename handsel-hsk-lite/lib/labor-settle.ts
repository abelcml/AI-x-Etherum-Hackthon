/**
 * Post-grading settlement for Labor Market jobs — extracted from

 *
 *   1. The submission callback (the moment grading finishes) — the fast
 *      path, exactly as before.
 *   2. sweepStuckGradedJobs() — the recovery path. Settlement used to be
 *      one-shot: a transient RPC failure (Alchemy free-tier 429s under
 *      polling load, observed live) at the approve/refund step left a
 *      PASSED job sitting in Submitted forever, showing manual
 *      approve/dispute buttons for work the grader had already judged.
 *      The sweep re-drives the correct path for any Submitted job whose
 *      spec already carries a grading verdict, from the same opportunistic
 *      read-path ticks the platform already uses (no cron).
 *
 * Both paths are safe to re-run: every branch re-checks the live on-chain
 * job status ('Submitted') before moving funds, so a retry after a partial
 * failure resumes rather than double-pays.
