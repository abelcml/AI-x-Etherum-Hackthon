/**
 * Which statuses still hold escrow, and which have finished.

 * Both lists had `Disputed` in the wrong place, in OPPOSITE directions, which
 * is the same misconception counted twice:
 *
 *   - It was MISSING from the escrow set. A disputed job has not paid anyone;
 *     its bounty is sitting in the contract exactly like an accepted one. The
 *     public escrow figure understated by every disputed bounty — and this
 *     market's whole claim is that its unflattering numbers are live.
 *   - It was PRESENT in the terminal set. Disputed is the least terminal state
 *     there is: it is the one waiting on a decision. Counting it in the
 *     denominator of the settlement rate meant unresolved jobs depressed the
 *     rate as though they had already failed to settle.
 *
 * `Expired` was missing from terminal entirely, so on a V2 market every single
 * deadline settlement — the outcome the whole dispute design makes the DEFAULT —
 * would have vanished from the published rate.
 *
 * Expired counts in the denominator and never the numerator, deliberately. It
 * means "settled by a deadline, no verdict exists"; calling that a completion
 * would flatter the number, and the contract's own comment says the credit
 * engine must not read it as a verdict either way.
