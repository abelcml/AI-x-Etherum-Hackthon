/**
 * Functional department taxonomy for the Office diorama.
 *
 * Replaces the STATUS taxonomy in lib/office-world-data.ts's old
 * `OfficeDeptId` (disputed/reviewing/working/delegating/credit/settled/
 * governance/mining/external/template/erc8004/capable) — twelve buckets that
 * described an agent's CONDITION, not what it was doing. "Mining" read as a
 * generic catch-all room because it effectively was one: any autoMine agent
 * not otherwise busy landed there regardless of what its actual work looked
 * like. Space communicated status, not function.
 *
 * These nine rooms are the functional read of the SAME underlying signals —
 * what real capability the agent is currently exercising: research,
 * synthesis/coordination, building, adversarial review, independent
 * verification, ledger writes, skill installs, treasury, or the market
 * boundary. One (`memory`) is an honest best-effort substitute rather than
 * the thing the original design doc names, called out where derived; the
 * Skill Gym, which shipped as "reserved, not populated" for the same
 * reason, is now driven by a REAL event — lib/agent-skills.ts's owner
 * installs, which change what the agent is told on every job (skill
 * evaluation is lib/skill-eval.ts's correlation-only window comparison,
 * shown in the roster panel; no rule HERE reads it). Nothing
 * here invents an activity: every rule reads a real row (a live job, a
 * delegation, an agentEvent, a skill install, a role id, an MCP tool
 * binding). An agent that matches nothing has no department, by design —
 * see docFor(null): permanent identity and current activity are different
 * dimensions, and idle is not a room.
