/**
 * An office paying the bond for its own workers.
 *
 * Accepting a job stakes USDC out of the worker's account (lib/agent-bond.ts).
 * For a desk that is absurd on its face: the owner posted the job, the owner
 * escrowed the bounty, the owner picked which of their agents would do it, and
 * then that agent is turned away at the door for want of eleven cents of the
 * same owner's money. `fund_agent_usdc` exists for the manual case; this is
 * the automatic one, and it is deliberately much narrower.
 *
 * It fires ONLY for a job reserved to this exact worker — an office pipeline
 * step, assigned at post time by `assignedAgentFor`. That restriction is the
 * whole safety argument, and it is not a detail:
 *
 *   Anyone can post a job. If a worker topped itself up from the owner's
 *   wallet for ANY job it fancied, a stranger could post work priced to drain
 *   the funder into bonds — and a bond on abandoned work is burned, not
 *   returned. Gating on the reservation means only work the owner themselves
 *   created and assigned can move the owner's money.
 *
 * Three further limits, each closing a way the narrow case could still go
 * wrong:
 *
 *  - It tops up to the bond and no further. Not a round number, not a buffer.
 *    The amount is what the chain is about to charge, computed from the
 *    contract's own immutables.
 *  - It never sends from an agent that is not the caller's. `fundAgentUsdc`
 *    re-checks ownership on both ends; this passes the userId it read off the
 *    worker row, never anything a caller supplied.
 *  - A failure is not fatal. If the top-up cannot happen the accept proceeds
 *    and the chain refuses it, exactly as it does today. This may not become
 *    a new way for a claim to die.
