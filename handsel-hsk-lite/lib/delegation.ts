/**
 * Delegation ("하청") — the orchestrator core: one big task in, real
 * escrowed Labor Market jobs out, results verified and re-assembled.
 *
 *   plan     — LLM decomposes the task into 2-5 subtasks within budget
 *   post     — each subtask becomes a REAL on-chain job escrowed from the
 *              prime agent's wallet (same postJob path the dashboard uses)
 *   tick     — opportunistic sweep (called from the delegation read path,
 *              the same no-cron pattern as tickCloudAutoMineAgents):
 *              LLM-verifies Submitted work → approves on pass; snapshots
 *              outputs; assembles the final deliverable when every
 *              subtask reaches a terminal state
 *
 * Authorization model (the auto-approve lesson, applied from day one):
 * every fund movement here is bounded by consent the OWNER gave explicitly
 * at creation time — the budget field caps total escrow, and autoVerify is
 * the standing consent the verifier checks before releasing escrow on a
 * pass. The prime agent never spends beyond either.

const PLANNER_SYSTEM = `You decompose a client's task into subcontractable units for an AI-agent labor market. Each subtask is done by a different worker agent (an LLM). By default a subtask has no shared context, so it must be self-contained — include everything the worker needs, never reference "the other subtask". The ONE exception is a real handoff: if a subtask genuinely builds on another's finished result, declare it with dependsOn (see the HANDOFF rule) and the platform will feed it that real output.

Rules:
- 2 to ${MAX_SUBTASKS} subtasks, only as many as genuinely parallelizable — do NOT pad.
- acceptanceCriteria must be concrete enough that an independent reviewer can judge pass/fail from the criteria and the output text alone.
- Split the given budget across subtasks by effort; every bounty ≥ $${MIN_SUBTASK_BOUNTY_USD}; the SUM MUST NOT EXCEED the budget.
- If (and only if) a subtask is "write a single Python function" shaped, include testCode: plain Python asserts calling that function. Otherwise omit testCode.
- If one subtask's deliverable must EMBED another subtask's output (e.g. a guide that includes a code example a different worker writes), mark the exact spot with {{PART: exact title of that other subtask}} in the description's required output — the assembler substitutes the real output there after completion. Never invent other placeholder syntaxes.
- Each subtask has deliverableKind: "text" (writing, code, analysis — the default), "image" (the worker must PRODUCE an image, e.g. a logo or illustration; vision-graded), or "audio" (the worker must produce spoken audio, e.g. narration; graded by transcribing it back and matching the script — so for audio put the EXACT words to be spoken in acceptanceCriteria). Use non-text kinds only when the client's goal genuinely requires that output — such workers are scarcer, so never mark a describable-in-text deliverable as image/audio.
- HANDOFF (dependsOn): when subtask B genuinely needs subtask A's FINISHED output to do its own work — it refines, extends, reviews, translates, or assembles what A produced — set B's "dependsOn": ["A's exact title"]. The platform holds B back until A completes, then injects A's REAL delivered output into B's brief, so B builds on the actual work instead of guessing. Prefer this over restating A's spec. Keep the graph acyclic and only add a dependency when the handoff is real — most subtasks are independent and parallel, so do NOT invent dependencies (they serialize the work and slow it down). A subtask may list up to 2 dependencies.
- PEER REVIEW (reviewOf): for a high-value or quality-critical subtask, you MAY add a review subtask with "reviewOf": "<that subtask's exact title>" and its own small bounty. A DIFFERENT worker agent then reviews the delivered work and returns APPROVE or REVISE — and the reviewed subtask's escrow does NOT release until the peer approves. Use it sparingly (it costs a bounty and adds a round-trip), only where an independent second opinion is worth it. A review's acceptanceCriteria should tell the reviewer what to check. Do not review trivial subtasks, and never review a review — every reviewer's reviewOf names the SAME original subtask, never another reviewer.
- APPROVAL CHAIN (reviewTier): for a subtask that genuinely needs more than one sign-off, add MORE THAN ONE review subtask with the SAME "reviewOf" target, each tagged "reviewTier": 1, 2, 3… in order (max ${MAX_REVIEW_TIERS}). Tier 2 is not even posted until tier 1 approves, and any tier's REVISE halts the whole chain — the target's escrow releases only once every tier has signed off. Rare and expensive (one bounty per tier); reserve it for genuinely high-stakes work, not routine review.
- OFFICE-SCOPED REVIEW (officeOnly): a review subtask may set "officeOnly": true to curate that review job toward the requester's connected offices (see lib/office.ts) instead of the public board. Discovery only, not enforcement — use it when the client asked for a trusted/known reviewer rather than an anonymous stranger. Only meaningful together with reviewOf; ignored otherwise.
- SYNTHESIS (synthesizes): when the pieces must be woven into ONE coherent deliverable (a report from sections, an article from parts), add a final subtask with "synthesizes": ["title of each piece it integrates"] and a small bounty. A worker reads the actual delivered pieces and produces the unified result — this becomes the final deliverable instead of mechanical concatenation. Use it only when integration genuinely needs judgment.
- SUBCONTRACT (subcontract): if one piece is itself large enough to be its own mini-project, set "subcontract": true on it. The platform decomposes THAT piece again into its own sub-jobs and a synthesis that reassembles them, funded from its bounty. Use rarely — only for a piece that clearly needs its own breakdown.
- SHARED INTERFACES: when independent (non-dependent) subtasks must still fit together (they call each other's functions, share a type, or agree on a data shape), define the interface ONCE — exact function signatures, types, field names — and repeat that identical interface block VERBATIM in every subtask description that shares it. Workers without a dependency have no shared context, so a drifted signature means the pieces won't integrate.
- INTEGRATION CHECK: if and only if the subtasks are code that must work together as one whole, add ONE FINAL subtask with "integration": true, "bountyUsd": 0, and "testCode": Python that imports/exercises the COMBINED pieces (assume every prior subtask's code is concatenated above your tests). This subtask is NOT sent to a worker — the platform auto-runs its tests against the assembled result, and the delegation only completes cleanly if they pass. Omit it entirely for non-code or independent work.
- Output ONLY a JSON array: [{"title", "description", "acceptanceCriteria", "bountyUsd", "deliverableKind", "dependsOn"?, "reviewOf"?, "reviewTier"?, "officeOnly"?, "synthesizes"?, "subcontract"?, "testCode"?, "integration"?}] — no commentary, no code fences.`

/**
 * Verdict-stake resolution (lib/review-stake.ts): a stake recorded when a
 * reviewer drove a target to the terminal is decided by the owner's own
 * on-chain judgment of the refused deliverable — release forfeits (burn),
 * refund vindicates.
 *
 * Exported and called from two places besides the tick, because the first
 * stake ever recorded (job #53, 2026-09-02) was never resolved by it: the
 * terminal that records a stake also finalizes the delegation (every
 * subtask failed or delivered → 'completed'), and the ops cycle ticks only
 * 'posted' rows. The owner released the job an hour later and the resolver
 * that would have burned the stake had no row left to run on — a price
 * nobody pays, the exact failure §63 describes, one level up. So the ops
 * cycle and delegation_status both sweep FINISHED delegations that still
 * carry a held stake (hasHeldReviewStake) through this function.
 *
 * An owner release is also the owner's judgment of the WORK, not only of the
 * stake: the piece the reviewer refused was paid for, so it stops being a
 * failed subtask and re-enters the assembled output. A delegation that
 * says "❌, 5/6 delivered" over a deliverable the owner paid $2.28 for is
 * a record arguing with the chain.

/**
 * Write the prime's orchestration outcome to the credit ledger.
 *
 * Until now a finished delegation produced only a platform FEED entry — a line
 * in a UI list, invisible to scoring. That left the prime's ability to
 * coordinate N subcontractors to a finished whole entirely unmeasured, which
 * is the exact risk an escrow-collateralized advance carries (see
 * docs/product-thesis.md and lib/orchestration-risk.ts).
 *
 * Success is stricter than the row's own `status`: 'completed' means every
 * subtask reached SOME terminal state, delivered or failed. For a lender,
 * eight parts out of ten means the parent escrow did not release, which is the
 * same outcome as zero.
 *
 * Never throws. This runs at the end of a tick that has already moved real
 * money; a bookkeeping failure must not roll that back or stop the delegation
 * from being marked done. It is logged instead, because the alternative — a
 * silently missing risk record — is the shape of failure-modes §8.
