/**
 * Repo Care — the first vertical, and the reason the office is the product.
 *
 * The pitch is one sentence: overnight the office reads a repository's
 * backlog, does the tests, docs and low-risk bugs, and by morning there are
 * pull requests with their verification beside them. Anything that touches
 * production, a secret, a dependency or money waited for a person instead.
 *
 * This module is the judgement in that sentence, and nothing else — it is
 * pure, so what Repo Care will and will not pick up is a table you can read
 * and a test can pin, rather than a prompt's mood.
 *
 * The design decision worth stating: **triage is conservative and boring on
 * purpose.** A wrong skip costs the customer one issue that stays open,
 * which they were living with anyway. A wrong pick-up spends a night
 * producing a PR that a person then has to read, judge and close — the
 * exact cost the product claims to remove. So the skip list is a fixed set
 * of labels and words, not a model's opinion, and an issue that says
 * nothing useful is skipped rather than guessed at.
