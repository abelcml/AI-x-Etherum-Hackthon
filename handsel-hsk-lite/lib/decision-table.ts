/**
 * A tiny DMN-style decision table — the trust gates ("when does escrow
 * auto-release?", "how high is a worker's ceiling?") as readable, auditable
 * rules instead of logic scattered across the settlement code.
 *
 * This is a PROJECTION, in the same spirit as the collab DSL: JSON/code stays
 * the substrate, this rides on top as the human-facing decision layer — but
 * the auto-release table is also the ACTUAL authority the settlement path
 * consults (see lib/labor-settle.ts), so the printed table and the running
 * rule can never drift.
 *
 * Deliberately not a full DMN/FEEL engine (that's a heavyweight standard). A
 * cell is one of: '-' (any), a comparison (>=600, <=50, >0, <5), a range
 * ([600..825]), or a literal (pass, true, 42). Hit policy FIRST — the first
 * matching rule wins, top to bottom. Pure and dependency-free.
