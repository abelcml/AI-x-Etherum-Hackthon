/**
 * The rising-price tick: walk unclaimed jobs up toward their ceiling until
 * somebody takes one.
 *
 * ## Why a raise is a cancel-and-repost
 *
 * The LaborMarket contract escrows a job's bounty at postJob and pays that
 * exact amount at approveJob — there is no partial release and no top-up. So
 * a bounty cannot be edited in place: raising it means cancelling the old job
 * (which refunds the requester in full) and posting a fresh one at the higher
 * price. That is only safe while the job is still **Open**, because
 * cancelling a job somebody has already committed to would destroy their
 * work, so every raise re-checks live on-chain status first.
 *
 * This reuses the repost machinery the failed-grading path already relies on,
 * including `parentSpecHash`, so anything following the work — a delegation,
 * a watcher — follows it to the new job id.
 *
 * Best-effort and idempotent, like the other sweeps: safe to call from a hot
 * read path, and a crash mid-flight leaves either the old job or the new one
 * standing, never both.
