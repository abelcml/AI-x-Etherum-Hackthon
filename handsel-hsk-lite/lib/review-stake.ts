/**
 * Verdict stake — the reviewer's pay is accountable to its verdict.
 *
 * Measured problem (2026-09-01/02, three finished review conversations):
 * eight verdicts, zero APPROVEs. With identical pay for either verdict, a
 * paid fault-finder treats REVISE as always defensible, and brief-level
 * fixes — an explicit approval standard, a final-round disclosure — moved
 * nothing. The reviewer's judgments were often RIGHT (a fabricated citation
 * caught, a truncation caught); what the market lacked was any cost to
 * refusing closure forever.
 *
 * The stake prices exactly that, with a NON-RECURSIVE ground truth: the
 * owner's own on-chain judgment of the deliverable the reviewer refused.
 *
 *  - A conversation the reviewer CLOSES (APPROVE) never stakes anything.
 *  - A conversation the reviewer stonewalls to hand-to-owner records a
 *    stake of half the review bounty. Then the chain decides:
 *      · owner RELEASES the target's escrow (the work was acceptable —
 *        the reviewer is overruled by the money authority) → the stake is
 *        BURNED. Burned, not paid to the owner: paying it to the party who
 *        decides the trigger makes overruling profitable, the same reason
 *        LaborMarketV2 burns a slashed bond instead of paying the requester.
 *      · target is REFUNDED (the owner declined the work, or let the
 *        deadline agree with the reviewer) → the stake returns; the REVISE
 *        was vindicated.
 *      · anything else → still held; the chain has not decided yet.
 *
 * The trigger is a mechanical on-chain state transition — no LLM opinion
 * can move this money (lib/evidence-assurance.ts's rule, kept). On
 * real-money deployments the burn transfer additionally refuses without
 * REVIEW_STAKE_ALLOW_REAL_MONEY=true, the lineage-mandate pattern: the
 * VERDICT is still recorded; only the movement waits for the flag.
 *
 * Known limit, stated: a wrong APPROVE is not staked in v1 — the appeal
 * machinery is the natural trigger for that side and is not wired here.
 * The asymmetry is deliberate: the observed failure is never-approve, and
 * an unstaked APPROVE is exactly the nudge the equilibrium needs.
