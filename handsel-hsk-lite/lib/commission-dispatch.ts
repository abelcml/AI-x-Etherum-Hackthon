/**
 * Drive a paid commission's own accepted work forward, from the customer's
 * poll.
 *
 * The problem this exists for: the step that turns an *accepted* job into a
 * *running* one — `fleetTick` in lib/ops-cycle.ts, which calls
 * `tickCloudAutoMineAgents` → `dispatchAcceptedJob` → `runAgentTask` — is
 * cron-only. It is not in the `fast` subset that ordinary page traffic
 * drives, and `/api/cron/settle`'s own header says so plainly: *"the two
 * steps that move an open plan forward — fleetTick (mining) and delegations
 * — are not in it. They run here or nowhere."*
 *
 * `commissionStatus` already ticks the delegation on every poll, so a
 * customer polling their order advances waves, review gates and settlement.
 * It did not advance DISPATCH. The observable result on a deployment whose
 * heartbeat is slow or absent: an outside customer pays, the pipeline
 * escrows, a worker accepts — and then nothing happens, for as long as the
 * operator's cron stays quiet. Money taken, nothing delivered, no error
 * anywhere. For a storefront that advertises itself as unattended, that is
 * worse than the paywall hole: it fails the customer rather than the house.
 *
 * So this closes the gap for the one case where the office has already been
 * paid to act. Three properties make it safe to run from an untrusted
 * caller's poll:
 *
 *  - **Scoped.** Only jobs belonging to THIS commission's delegation. It
 *    cannot be used to make the platform work on anything else.
 *  - **Idempotent.** A subtask whose spec already has an `agentTaskId` was
 *    dispatched; it is skipped. Polling in a tight loop dispatches nothing
 *    twice, which is the same guard auto-mine's own self-heal relies on.
 *  - **Bounded.** At most MAX_DISPATCH_PER_POLL per call.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT gated on `agent.autoMine`, which is the one place this
 * differs from `autoMineTick`. That flag answers "should this agent go
 * looking for work"; it has no bearing on work the agent already accepted
 * and a customer already paid for. Gating here would mean an office could
 * take money for a job it then declines to start.
