/**
 * Making a coordination note impossible to merge without reading.
 *
 * `conversation.md` is where agents working this repo at the same time warn
 * each other. On 2026-09-01 it worked and it did not, in the same hour:
 *
 *   08:10  the office-harness session pushes a note — a live round is running,
 *          a local worker is polling, do not rewire that agent
 *   08:34  this session pulls. `conversation.md | 20 ++++++++++++++++++++`
 *          is printed in the merge diffstat, and read, and skipped
 *   08:34  this session pushes and reports done
 *   08:45  the owner says "read conversation.md"
 *   08:52  reading it turns up a real defect in code shipped at 08:27 — the
 *          harness preflight probe was running in the owner's checkout with
 *          the harness's auto-approval flag on
 *
 * The channel was fine. The note was specific, it was correct, and it was
 * about code that had gone in seven minutes earlier. It sat in the working
 * tree for eleven minutes and its own filename appeared on screen.
 *
 * So the lesson is not "write better notes". **A coordination artifact that
 * depends on being voluntarily read is ignored by exactly the agent that most
 * needs it** — an agent mid-task is optimising for its task, and an unfamiliar
 * file in a merge diffstat reads as somebody else's business.
 *
 * The fix is to stop asking. This turns the note into a gate: unacknowledged
 * changes to `conversation.md` fail `npm run gates`, which every commit runs,
 * and the failure prints the note. Nothing has to be remembered and nothing
 * relies on an instruction being followed.
 *
 * Pure here; the file and git plumbing live in scripts/conversation-check.mjs.

/**
 * Where the acknowledgement lives under `.git/`, derived from the note's
 * filename the same way the portable skill does it
 * (`.claude/skills/parallel-repo-coordination/scripts/coordination-check.mjs`).
 *
 * The two used to disagree: the repo gate wrote `handsel-conversation-ack`,
 * the skill wrote `coordination-ack-conversation_md`, so acknowledging through
 * one (the skill's `--note`, which acks as a side effect of writing) left the
 * other still refusing — a spurious "unread" that looked exactly like a new
 * note from another session. One derivation, mirrored in both scripts and
 * pinned by tests/conversation-notes.test.ts. The legacy filename is still
 * read as a fallback so no existing working copy is re-gated by the rename.
