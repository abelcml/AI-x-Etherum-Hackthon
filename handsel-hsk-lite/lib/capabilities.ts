/**
 * What this deployment can actually do, and what would switch on the rest.
 *
 * Every optional feature in this app is env-gated and degrades to silence when
 * its configuration is absent — see CLAUDE.md, "Optional on-chain. Features
 * degrade gracefully without their env". That is the right behaviour and it has
 * one cost: **a feature that is off looks exactly like a feature that was never
 * built.** On a fresh deployment the whole product looks half-finished, and the
 * question "why did GitHub sign-in disappear" has no place to be answered.
 *
 * It had no place to be answered here either. Nine `is…Configured` predicates
 * were scattered across seven files, `/doctor` reported none of them, and the
 * only way to know a capability was dark was to notice its button missing.
 *
 * So: one table, evaluated live. No cached judgements, no hardcoded "should be
 * on" — each row calls the same predicate the feature itself calls, which is
 * what keeps this from drifting into a second opinion about the truth.

 * `throws` — nothing hides it. The button renders, the user clicks it, and the
 *            server throws mid-action. In production Next.js swallows the
 *            message and shows a digest, so the operator sees
 *            "An error occurred in the Server Components render" and has no
 *            way to learn which env var was missing.
 *
 * The second is worse, and the first version of this table missed all of them —
 * it scanned for `is…Configured` predicates, and a throw is not a predicate.
 * `API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` was unset on a live deployment, the inventory
 * answered "nothing is blocking", and the Generate button 500'd.
