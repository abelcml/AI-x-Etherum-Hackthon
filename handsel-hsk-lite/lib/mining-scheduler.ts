/**
 * Mining scheduler — the pure core of "which blocks does this agent take,
 * and how many at once".
 *
 * Historically auto-mine claimed exactly ONE job per tick and refused to
 * claim anything while the agent had any active task (a hard single-slot
 * idle gate). This module generalises that to N concurrent slots: given the
 * open jobs, the agent, and how many slots are free, it returns the ordered
 * subset of "blocks" (claimable work units) to attempt this tick.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function of its inputs — no db, no chain, no
 * imports with side effects — so the eligibility rules (the part that used to
 * live inline in the tick and was untested) are unit-tested in isolation. The
 * caller injects the two predicates that DO need context (`canDeliver`,
 * `isFaucetReserved`) so this file stays dependency-free.
 *
 * See docs/parallel-mining.md for the surrounding architecture.

 * Should auto-mine's self-heal (re-)dispatch an on-chain Accepted job this

 * Two heals, found months apart:
 *  - no task at all — a crash between accept and dispatch (the original);
 *  - a task that FAILED — dispatch ran and died off-chain, e.g. every
 *    assisted write 400ing while the platform model key was out of credits
 *    (live, 2026-08-31). The escrow sat Accepted-but-doomed until the
 *    deadline refunded it, because the heal saw an agentTaskId and moved on.
 *    A failed task is not a dispatched job; it is a dispatch that needs
 *    doing again, once the cooldown says the world may have changed.
 *
 * A task still queued/running/processing is genuinely in flight — never
 * double-dispatch over it (reapStuckTasks owns hung ones, marking them
 * failed, which routes them back here next sweep).
 *
 * Second finding, same incident: the runtime callback marks a task
 * `completed` even when the worker reported `success: false` — "the
 * worker's part is over" is that route's contract, and the failure lives in
 * `result.success`. So a dispatch that ran and reported its own failure
 * never reads as status 'failed' at all. Heal it by the pair
 * (status completed, reportedSuccess false) — while the on-chain job this
 * verdict is being asked about is still Accepted, that pair means "the
 * dispatch is over and produced nothing submittable". A completed task
 * whose worker reported success stays untouched: its submission or
 * settlement is someone else's in-flight work.
 *
 * Third finding, same incident: healing into a deadline that cannot be met.
 * The two-stage fix above shipped hours after the original dispatches died,
 * and the re-dispatch it finally fired had ~10 minutes of on-chain runway —
 * not enough for a dispatch (up to 4 minutes), a submission, and grading.
 * The work ran, the deadline sweep refunded the escrow anyway, and the
 * dispatch budget was pure waste. Same judgement assertFitToClaim makes at
 * claim time (deadline feasibility), applied at re-dispatch time: when the
 * governing deadline is known and closer than HEAL_MIN_RUNWAY_MS, let the
 * refund happen — that is the correct economic outcome, and the requester
 * reposts into a fresh window. Unknown runway never blocks (a V1 market has
 * no deadlines; an RPC gap must not freeze the heal).
