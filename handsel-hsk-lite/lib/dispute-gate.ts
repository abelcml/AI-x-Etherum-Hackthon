/**
 * The only thing on a V2 market that resolves a dispute.
 *
 * It never *decides* one. It opens and closes a dispute in the same pass, and
 * only when a refund is derivable from evidence the requester did not author —
 * see `decideRefund` in lib/decision-table.ts. Everything else settles on a
 * deadline, and the deadline pays the worker.
 *
 * ## The shape, and why it is a gate rather than a judge
 *
 * `resolveDispute(id, true)` and `expireDispute(id)` both call
 * `_payWorkerSide(job, job.bounty)` — identical money. So the arbiter is not a
 * judge choosing between two verdicts; it is a ONE-WAY GATE on the requester
 * winning. Silence already pays the worker. That means every bond, every
 * evidence rule and every escalation can live off-chain, behind this function,
 * with no contract change at all.
 *
 * ## What a stuck gate costs
 *
 * Nothing. If this file throws on every pass, `expireReview` settles Submitted
 * jobs at 90/10 and `expireDispute` settles Disputed ones to the worker, both
 * called by lib/deadline-sweep.ts, which shares no lease and no failure with
 * this. That is the property worth protecting: the policy layer is allowed to
 * be broken, because the backstop is not in it.
