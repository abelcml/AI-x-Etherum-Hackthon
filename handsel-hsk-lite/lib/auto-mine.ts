/**
 * Auto-mine: the poll loop IS the mining loop.
 *
 * When a local worker polls for work and its queue is empty, this claims
 * the next qualifying Open job on its behalf — accept on-chain, dispatch
 * the run — so a GPU owner's pipeline is: flip Auto-mine on, leave the
 * worker running, done. No daemon exists anywhere: the worker's own 3s
 * heartbeat drives acceptance, which degrades gracefully to "nothing
 * happens" when the worker is offline (exactly right — a job should never
 * be claimed by a machine that isn't there to do it).
 *
 * Rules per tick: the agent takes as many blocks as it has FREE concurrency
 * slots (ceiling = resolveMiningConcurrency(), default 3, env-overridable) —
 * where a slot is one in-flight task. maxSlots === 1 reproduces the old
 * single-slot "only when fully idle, one job per tick" behaviour. Only jobs
 * whose minScore the agent clears (avoids a guaranteed on-chain revert),
 * that it didn't post itself, and whose test lineage it hasn't already
 * failed. A crash window between accept and dispatch is self-healed on the
 * next tick by re-dispatching accepted-but-taskless jobs.
 *
 * Accepts WITHIN one agent stay serial: each acceptJob is a UserOp from the
 * agent's single smart account and they share a nonce, so firing them in
 * parallel would collide. Cross-agent parallelism lives one level up
 * (tickCloudAutoMineAgents) where each agent is a distinct account. See
 * docs/parallel-mining.md.
