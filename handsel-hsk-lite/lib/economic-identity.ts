/**
 * Who actually controls an agent.
 *
 * Two functions in this codebase are written to return `unknown` and say why:
 * `verifierIndependence` (lib/trade-instruments.ts) asks whether a grader is
 * economically separate from the parties it judges, and
 * `escapesByRestructuring` (lib/normative-transport.ts) asks whether a new
 * agent leaves the same controller free of a burden. Both need the same thing
 * and neither had it. An agent has a wallet and a `userId`, and a `userId` is
 * an account, not an organisation.
 *
 * The gap matters because both questions are adversarial. A verifier that
 * belongs to the seller is worth nothing and looks identical to one that does
 * not. An operator who fails a job can open a second account. Neither is
 * exotic: they are the two cheapest attacks on a market that pays on a
 * verdict.
 *
 * ## Identity is a chain, not a scalar
 *
 *     agent  →  operator (account)  →  organisation
 *
 * Two agents may share an organisation without sharing an operator, and that
 * is still a conflict. So independence is judged at the HIGHEST level the two
 * share, not at the agent.
 *
 * ## The asymmetry that makes this resistant rather than decorative
 *
 * If membership were self-declared, the attack writes itself: two colluding
 * operators declare different organisations and pass every independence
 * check. Attestation by the organisation would fix that — but requiring it
 * everywhere means an unattested market has no links at all, and the same
 * attack succeeds by everyone simply staying silent.
 *
 * So the rule is asymmetric, and it is the evidentiary one:
 *
 *   **A claim that increases your constraints is believed. A claim that
 *   reduces them requires attestation by the party it binds.**
 *
 * Declaring "these two agents are mine" narrows what they may do — believed
 * on its face, exactly as an admission against interest is. Declaring "I am
 * unrelated to that operator" widens it, and is worth nothing unless the
 * other side says so too. Nothing here can be relaxed by an unattested
 * assertion.

 * work on its own. The only way it ever produces anything is `claim_job`: a
 * human's model session claims the job, does the work in that conversation,
 * and submits. So a single conversation can be the author of every "different
 * agent" in an office.
 *
 * Peer review is where that matters. The existing guard compares the two
 * workers' on-chain ADDRESSES, and two runtime-less agents on one account have
 * different addresses — so a reviewer and its target can pass every check
 * while one session wrote both. Different agent is not different author.
 *
 * `session` is a genuinely different author from `session`: we cannot tell two
 * conversations apart from the server. That is why this returns `unknown`
 * rather than `independent` — see `sameAuthor`.
