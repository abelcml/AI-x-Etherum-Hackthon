/**
 * Agent skills — installing a ClawHub skill onto one of your own agents,
 * for real.
 *
 * "For real" is the load-bearing phrase. docs/office-departments.md has
 * said since Phase 1 that the Skill Gym room is "reserved, not populated"
 * because no skill install/eval subsystem existed — ClawHub
 * (lib/clawhub.ts) was read-only discovery, wired to nothing. The trap
 * this module exists to avoid is the decorative version: a table of slugs
 * that changes an agent's badge and nothing else. That would be fake
 * capability — the exact category of fabrication the "no fake data" rule
 * bans.
 *
 * What makes an install real here: ClawHub's detail API
 * (GET /api/v1/skills/{slug}) returns the skill's FULL instruction
 * document (the SKILL.md, frontmatter and all — verified against the live
 * API before this was written, not assumed). Installing snapshots that
 * document into `agent_skill`, and lib/agent-tasks.ts's `runAgentTask`
 * injects every installed skill's instructions into the agent's effective
 * task text — the same single choke point `customInstructions` already
 * flows through, which every runtime (platform, cloud, local, webhook)
 * reads. An installed skill therefore changes what the agent is actually
 * told to do on every subsequent job. The one exception is `mcp` runtime:
 * there the "task" may collapse to a bare `[mcp-query]` argument for a
 * single external tool that follows no instructions, so injecting an
 * instruction document is noise by construction — skipped, and documented
 * here rather than discovered later.
 *
 * Trust model, stated plainly (docs/security-audit.md: read before
 * touching a prompt path — this IS a prompt path):
 *  - A skill's instructions are third-party text granted instruction power
 *    over the owner's agent. The gate is the OWNER's explicit install
 *    action on their own agent — the same consent model as installing a
 *    skill in Claude itself, or this platform's own autoApprove. Nothing
 *    installs implicitly; peers/requesters cannot install onto your agent.
 *  - Snapshot-at-install: the content stored is the content the owner saw
 *    installed. A later upstream edit on ClawHub does NOT silently change
 *    the agent — re-installing is the only way to pick up a new version,
 *    and that is again an explicit owner action.
 *  - Bounded: instructions are capped (excerptForBrief, with the cut
 *    disclosed in the rendered block per lib/brief-excerpt.ts's rule that
 *    silent truncation is the defect), and installs per agent are capped,
 *    so the prompt cannot grow without bound.
 *
 * Evaluation lives next door in lib/skill-eval.ts: a before/after window
 * comparison of the agent's independently graded outcomes, split at
 * installed_at, delta gated on sample size, worded as correlation only —
 * its header carries the caveats. Reinstalling moves installed_at forward
 * on purpose: the new document is a new treatment and its "after" window
 * starts clean.
