/**
 * Agent lineage — heredity, fitness and selection for a market of workers.
 *
 * The idea is not ours and the prior art is worth naming, because what each
 * experiment got WRONG is what this module is shaped around.
 *
 *  - **The Automaton** (Sigil Wen / Conway Research, 2026): an agent that
 *    pays for its own compute, dies at zero, and on crossing a balance
 *    threshold spins up a copy, teaches it what it learned and seeds it with
 *    cash. Survival pressure is real; the fitness signal is voluntary human
 *    payment, which nothing independent verifies.
 *  - **Spore.fun** (Phala, 2024–25; arXiv:2506.04236): on-chain agents that
 *    serialize a JSON genome, mutate it, and spawn offspring when their token
 *    passes $500k market cap — dying on a 14-day timer otherwise. Five
 *    generations ran. The paper's own verdict is that no open-ended evolution
 *    occurred, and its diagnosis is the part that matters here: speculative
 *    attention became "a more powerful, albeit volatile, fitness gradient
 *    than any intrinsic trait". Market cap selects for hype, so hype is what
 *    it bred.
 *
 * That diagnosis is precisely the gap this platform already fills. Handsel's
 * fitness signal is not attention and not self-report: it is the independent
 * grader's verdict on delivered work (the same GRADED_PASS/FAIL event set
 * lib/skill-eval.ts, lib/agent-stats.ts and the Labor Index already agree on)
 * plus USDC that actually settled out of escrow. A worker cannot become fit
 * here by being popular, and it cannot grade itself. Selection on that signal
 * is selection on competence.
 *
 * Four rules, each one a correction of something the prior art did:
 *
 *  1. **Fitness is graded work, never attention or self-report.**
 *  2. **Death is retirement, not self-destruction.** Spore.fun burned failed
 *     agents and recycled their capital. Here an agent's history — its
 *     signed work proofs, its credit score, its failures — is evidence other
 *     people price decisions against; destroying it destroys the public
 *     record that makes this market legible. A retired agent stops working
 *     and stops being funded. It does not stop having existed.
 *  3. **The genotype is inherited; the phenotype is not.** A child gets its
 *     parent's instructions, skills and wiring, and starts at a genuine cold
 *     start — credit score zero, no history. This is not a new rule: it is
 *     the one agent_templates has enforced since it shipped (see its comment
 *     in lib/db/schema.ts). It is what makes this selection rather than
 *     dynasty.
 *  4. **No verdict without evidence.** A lifecycle call on three graded jobs
 *     is noise with a decision attached. Same discipline, and the same
 *     minimum, as skill-eval's window gate.
 *
 * Everything here is PURE — no chain, no database, no clock beyond what the
 * caller passes. Deciding that an agent should die or breed is exactly the
 * kind of arithmetic that has to be readable in a test rather than inferred
 * from production.

 * you take many draws, most are worse, selection cleans up. Here a trial
 * costs a real seeded wallet and takes days of graded work to evaluate, and
 * the market's volume means most agents never reach a measurable sample at
 * all. Under those economics random drift is indistinguishable from noise
 * with an invoice attached.
 *
 * So variation is introduced only where something was actually measured:

 *  1. Prune what is measurably hurting — the worst skill with a MEASURED
 *     negative delta.
 *  2. Otherwise adopt what is measurably helping elsewhere on the account —

 *  3. Otherwise change nothing. No evidence, no mutation: the same rule the
