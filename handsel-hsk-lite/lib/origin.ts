/**
 * This deployment's public origin, in one place.
 *
 * It used to be a hostname typed out in eighteen files. That was harmless
 * while there was exactly one deployment and became a real defect the moment
 * there were two: a fork inherits every one of those strings, and its users
 * are then handed the ORIGINAL deployment's links. The worst of them were the
 * MCP connect URLs — a user of the new market clicking "connect" would wire
 * their Claude or ChatGPT to the old one — and the email links, which pointed
 * every payout and claim-warning notice at somebody else's site.
 *
 * Resolution order, first hit wins:
 *
 *  1. `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` — set it when the deployment has a custom domain, or
 *     when Vercel's own value is not the URL you want users to see.
 *  2. `VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL` — the project's stable production host,
 *     which is what belongs in an email that outlives the deployment.
 *  3. `VERCEL_URL` — this specific deployment. Correct on a preview, wrong in
 *     anything durable, which is why it is third.
 *  4. `http://localhost:3000` — development.
 *
 * Note the ordering is deliberate: a per-deployment URL baked into a sent
 * email is a link that dies at the next deploy.
