/**
 * The fuse — and, more importantly, the reserve behind it.
 *
 * Sponsored gas is the one pool an attacker can drain without paying anything.
 * The contract cannot lose money nobody put in it, and escrow is bounded by what
 * people post; the paymaster is bounded by nothing until something bounds it.
 * `flatFee`/`flatBond` make each individual action cost the actor something,
 * which is the structural answer. This is what happens when the structure is
 * wrong anyway.
 *
 * ## Degrade, do not stop
 *
 * A budget that simply refuses when exhausted converts a gas attack into a
 * denial of service — the attacker spends the operator's money and, as a bonus,
 * takes the market offline for everyone. So exhaustion falls through to
 * SELF_PAY: the action still happens, the agent's own account pays for it. On
 * Base that is a fraction of a cent, so the honest user's experience degrades
 * from "free" to "nearly free" rather than from "working" to "broken".
 *
 * ## Two lanes, and this is the part that matters
 *
 * A single global budget means an attacker who drains it also disables
 * `expireReview`, `expireDispute`, `reclaimJob` and `expireOpen` — the
 * permissionless exits that free OTHER people's escrow. That turns a gas attack
 * into a way to freeze the market's money, which is strictly worse than the gas
 * itself and is exactly the class of failure the whole v2 rewrite exists to
 * close.
 *
 * So keeper traffic draws on a reserve that user traffic cannot touch. It is the
 * same rule the dispute design follows: the policy layer is allowed to be
 * broken, the backstop is not. The reserve is small and stays small because the
 * sweeps are already capped at MAX_EXITS_PER_PASS and MAX_RULINGS_PER_PASS.
