//! Handsel escrow core on Solana — a devnet port of `LaborMarketV2`.
//!
//! **Devnet only, by decision, not by omission.** The Base mainnet deployment
//! carries the verified contracts, the self-audit, the static analysis and the
//! open challenge; none of that trust transfers to a fresh Rust program in its
//! first month. This program earns the same standing the same way — or it
//! stays on devnet. See `docs/solana-port.md` for the full scope contract.
//!
//! What is ported: the money loop. post (bounty + fee escrowed) → accept
//! (worker stakes a bond) → submit (resultHash on chain) → approve or review
//! timeout (pull-payment credit) → withdraw. Plus the two exits that kept v1
//! escrow from freezing: cancel (Open) and reclaim (Accepted, past deadline,
//! bond burned — a slash paid to any party who can influence the slash is an
//! incentive to manufacture it, so nobody gets it).
//!
//! What is deliberately NOT here (v0.1 cuts, each documented in the port doc):
//! disputes/arbiter, assignable payees (liens), the silence forfeit split,
//! open-window expiry, lending, governance.
//!
//! Invariants carried over from the EVM contract, in its own words:
//! - **Pull payments.** Settlement credits `Withdrawable`; only `withdraw`
//!   moves tokens out. The one thing this program must never do is pay the
//!   same balance twice, so balances are zeroed before the transfer CPI.
//! - **`result_hash` is set by `submit_work` and nothing else.** A zero hash
//!   means no submission landed — the exact signal lib/job-grade.ts reads on
//!   the EVM side, kept bit-compatible on purpose.
//! - **Solvency is one comparison.** `total_escrowed + total_withdrawable`
//!   must never exceed the vault balance; every mutation maintains it.
