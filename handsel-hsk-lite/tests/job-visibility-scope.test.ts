/**
 * 권한레벨 vs 공개레벨 — the split between "who may claim" and "who may see".
 *
 * The rule (`officeJobVisible`, tested in tests/office.test.ts) existed for
 * months while every office pipeline's briefs sat fully public on the market
 * board: only reviewOf steps carried `officeOnly`, and only the listing was
 * filtered — get_job, get_contract and the claim paths handed the brief to
 * anyone with a job number. Same defect class as real-money-wiring.test.ts:
 * the logic was correct and unreachable.
 *
 * So this pins the WIRING, not the rule:
 *  - every office-hire step is scoped at the source (officeOnly: true),
 *  - delegation stores the scope for any server-set officeOnly step (the
 *    planner LLM stays restricted to reviewOf — it must not be able to hide
 *    market work),
 *  - both accept paths refuse a claim from outside the office circle,
 *  - both MCP read tools (get_job, get_contract) redact the brief,
 *  - the /world open-jobs board filters like every other listing.
 *
 * Source assertions because the call sites read the chain and the DB at
 * module load; what can be checked without an environment is checked as code.
