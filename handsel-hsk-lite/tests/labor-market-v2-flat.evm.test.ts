/**
 * A percentage cannot cover a fixed cost, and gas is a fixed cost.
 *
 * Every job consumes roughly the same number of sponsored UserOps whatever its
 * bounty — post, accept, submit, approve, and the withdrawals — so the
 * operator's expense per job is FLAT while a bps fee scales with the bounty.
 *
 * That is not a tuning problem, it is an arithmetic one. `MAX_FEE_BPS` is 500,
 * so on a $0.05 bounty the fee CANNOT exceed $0.0025 no matter what a deployment
 * chooses, against a gas envelope an order of magnitude larger. Raising the
 * percentage does not reach; the ceiling is a fraction of a number that is
 * itself tiny. And the same arithmetic breaks the bond on the other side: 5% of
 * $0.05 puts $0.0025 at risk, so `acceptJob` stays effectively free exactly
 * where the market is thinnest — and a free `acceptJob` is the one action an
 * attacker repeats at zero cost while the operator pays gas for each one.
 *
 * So both sides get a flat component. These tests are about the property that
 * motivated it: **the fee covers the job's gas envelope at ANY bounty size.**
