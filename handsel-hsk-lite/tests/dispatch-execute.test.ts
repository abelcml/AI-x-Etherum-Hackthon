/**
 * Dispatch execution survives the request that started it.
 *
 * The defect (2026-08-31, live): cloud/mcp dispatch ran in the CALLING
 * request's after(), sharing its duration budget. Four office dispatches
 * behind one cron tick all died with the function — every task 'running'
 * until the 30-minute reap, zero callbacks, escrow refunded at the deadline.
 *
 * The fix is a handoff: runAgentTask POSTs the task id to
 * /api/runtime/execute (authenticated with CRON_SECRET), and that route runs
 * ONE dispatch in an invocation of its own. These are wiring pins in the
 * style of real-money-wiring.test.ts — the rule is trivial, the defect was
 * always in who actually calls what.
