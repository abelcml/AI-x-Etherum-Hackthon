/**
 * A server action must not use `throw` to tell a user something they can fix.
 *
 * Next.js strips server-action error messages in production and replaces them
 * with a digest. The browser gets:
 *
 *   An error occurred in the Server Components render. The specific message is
 *   omitted in production builds to avoid leaking sensitive details.
 *
 * So `throw new Error('Set a payout wallet first')` — a perfectly clear
 * sentence — arrived as that paragraph plus `digest: '1363688840'`. Worse, the
 * client's `catch (e) { setError(e.message) }` looks like it handles this, and
 * in development it does: the message survives there. The mechanism only fails
 * where nobody is watching a console.
 *
 * Two things had to change, and this pins both:
 *
 *   1. The precondition is checked in the UI where it is knowable, so the click
 *      never happens. Withdraw-all was gated on the INPUT BOX rather than on
 *      the saved address, so typing an address and pressing Withdraw instead of
 *      Save enabled the button while the server still had nothing stored.
 *   2. Where the UI cannot know (the per-agent card never receives the payout
 *      address), the action RETURNS the failure. A returned value crosses the
 *      boundary intact.
