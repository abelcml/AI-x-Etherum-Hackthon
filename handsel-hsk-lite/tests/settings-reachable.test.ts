/**
 * Capabilities have to be reachable from the page a person would look on.
 *
 * Three times now a feature has been built, correct, and effectively hidden:
 * the storefront switch existed only in the MCP connector
 * (docs/failure-modes.md §42); the commission dispatcher ran only from a
 * cron; and GitHub — sign-in AND the App that opens pull requests — was
 * linked from /start, from /admin/access, and from error text you only see
 * after something has already failed. Settings, the page you open to connect
 * an account, said nothing about GitHub at all.
 *
 * None of those looked broken. A capability nobody can find behaves exactly
 * like a capability nobody wants, and that is the reading it invites — which
 * is why this is worth a test rather than a note.
