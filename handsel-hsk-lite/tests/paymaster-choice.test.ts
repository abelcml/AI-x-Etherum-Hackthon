 * stopped working, the apparent choice was to keep account abstraction or keep
 * sponsored gas. Those are not coupled: paymaster communication is ERC-7677,
 * viem ships a generic client, and a Kernel account does not care who signs the
 * sponsorship. What looked like a vendor lock was a shared string.
 *
 * Source assertions, because the resolution reads process.env at module load and
 * building a real client needs a network. What can be checked without an
 * environment is checked as code — and the thing most worth checking is that
