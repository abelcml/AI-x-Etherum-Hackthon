/**
 * A feature must be gated on what IT needs, and nothing else.
 *
 * `isLaborMarketConfigured()` called `isAgentAccountConfigured()`, which called
 * `isOnchainConfigured()`, which requires `CREDIT_VAULT_ADDRESS`. So a labour
 * market that was deployed, funded and correct reported itself unconfigured
 * because an unrelated contract had not been deployed.
 *
 * The symptom was `GET /api/tasks` answering `503 unconfigured` with the market
 * address sitting in the env — and note that the 503 was the HONEST answer to a
 * wrong question. The three-valued feed did its job; the predicate underneath
 * was asking about the vault.
 *
 * The vault appears in `lib/onchain/credit.ts` and nowhere else. Borrow and
 * repay need it. Posting a job does not.
 *
 * These are source assertions because the predicates read `process.env` at
 * module load, so importing them under a fixed environment is the one thing a
 * unit test cannot do cleanly here.
