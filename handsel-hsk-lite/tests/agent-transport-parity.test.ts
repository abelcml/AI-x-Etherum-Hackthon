/**
 * Every agent write goes through the mode-aware sender. No exceptions.
 *
 * `sendAgentCall` handles both transports: a sponsored UserOp in kernel mode, a
 * plain transaction in EOA mode. It also carries the gas fuse. Two writes needed
 * to send TWO calls together — `approve` + `postJob`, `approve` + `acceptJob` —
 * and because `sendAgentCall` took a single call, both reached past it to
 * `getAgentKernel` + `sendUserOperation`.
 *
 * That made **posting a job** and **accepting a job** the only two labour-market
 * writes that were kernel-only. On this deployment, which is EOA, there is no
 * bundler and no paymaster, so both were structurally impossible — while submit,
 * approve, dispute, cancel, withdraw and every token transfer worked normally.
 *
 * The symptom was therefore not "on-chain is broken". It was "I cannot post a
 * job and I cannot mine", with everything else fine, and no error to read
 * because the failure was in the half of the code the fuse never saw either:
 * neither path called `decideSponsorship` or `recordGasSpend`, so the two most
 * expensive operations in the system were the two the budget could not count.
 *
 * `sendAgentCalls` is now the single door, and this test is what keeps the next
 * batch write from going around it.
