/**
 * The deadline lattice — a deadline is only worth what the guard on it is worth.
 *
 * Round 1 added five deadlines and four permissionless exits, and gave exactly
 * one of them a matching upper-bound guard: `submitWork` reverts `TooLate` past
 * `deliveryDeadline`. Every other privileged action survives its deadline
 * forever.
 *
 * That is deliberate and correct wherever the party keeping the power past the
 * deadline is the deadline's OWN PRINCIPAL. A requester who disputes on day
 * eight is not a silent requester; an arbiter who rules on day fifteen is not a
 * missing arbiter. Adding a `TooLate` there would manufacture a strictly worse
 * state — a job past both windows, settleable only by a stranger's altruism.
 * Those places were checked and deliberately left alone.
 *
 * It is not correct in the two cases below, and the useful thing about both is
 * that neither is a defect in any single round-1 fix. Each is a COMPOSITION of
 * two of them:
 *
 *   assignPayee  ×  submitWork's new TooLate
 *       Before the TooLate gate, an `Accepted` job past its delivery deadline
 *       was a race — the worker MIGHT still deliver. After it, that job is
 *       provably dead: the only transition left is reclaimJob → 100% requester.
 *       The gate is what turned "probably worthless collateral" into
 *       "collateral that is unreachable with certainty" — and `releaseSplit`,
 *       the function that exists so a lender never has to reimplement the
 *       split, went on quoting a number for it.
 *
 *   acceptJob  ×  expireOpen
 *       expireOpen did not close `Open`; it only added a door out of it. So
 *       `acceptJob` still works at day 61, and taking the job slams that door —
 *       and the requester's own cancelJob with it. `openExpirable()` is a free
 *       public view that names precisely the requesters who have not looked at
 *       this contract in sixty days, which is the same population for whom both
 *       stated mitigations of the silence forfeit are void.
 *
 * Written against the contract BEFORE these guards existed, where each one
 * failed by performing the attack: the lien was perfected on a dead job and the
 * lender withdrew 0, and a stranger banked the 10% forfeit on a job whose
 * requester was entitled to 100% of it back.
