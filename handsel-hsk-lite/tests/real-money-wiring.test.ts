/**
 * The guard is CALLED. That is the whole point of this file.
 *
 * `tests/mainnet-guard.test.ts` already proves the conditions are right. It
 * passed, continuously, while `realMoneyBlockers`, `decimalsBlocker` and
 * `formatBlockers` had zero callers anywhere in the app — only `mintBlocker` was
 * wired. Eight blockers, fully written, fully tested, documented in
 * docs/mainnet-deploy.md as something that **refuses**, and on
 * `ONCHAIN_CHAIN=base` they would have refused nothing.
 *
 * So this tests the wiring, not the rules. It is the distinction that ran through
 * every defect in this codebase's recent history: `withdraw()` with no callers,
 * the four permissionless exits with no callers, `agentAccountMode` in no
 * endpoint, CLAUDE.md's "traffic driven" sweeps with no traffic trigger. In every
 * case the logic was correct and unreachable, and no test of the logic could
 * have noticed.
 *
 * Source assertions, because the call sites read `process.env` and the chain at
 * module load. What can be checked without an environment is checked as code.
