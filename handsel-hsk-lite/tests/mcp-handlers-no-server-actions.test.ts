/**
 * Shared code must not call a server action that authenticates from the
 * session.
 *
 * The two surfaces authenticate differently. A server action resolves its
 * caller from the session COOKIE; an MCP request carries an OAuth token and
 * has no cookie. So an action reached from the MCP path throws
 * "Unauthorized" for every caller — and nothing static catches it. tsc
 * resolves the import, lint passes, the unit tests pass, the production build
 * passes.
 *
 * It shipped twice in one afternoon. `wire_office_agent` called
 * `setMcpWorker` and failed loudly on its first real invocation.
 * `hireOfficeTemplateFor` called the same action inside a try/catch, so
 * `hire_office` failed SILENTLY: it created six agents, wired none of them,
 * and returned success — every reader a plain platform agent answering from
 * memory, which is precisely what that desk exists to prevent. The second one
 * was only caught because the roster was read afterwards.
 *
 * The fix in both cases is the split lib/mcp-worker-wiring.ts and
 * lib/office-hire.ts now use: the core takes a userId, the action supplies it
 * from the session, the MCP handler supplies it from the verified token.
