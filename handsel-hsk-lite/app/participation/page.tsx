/**
 * /participation — the participation disclosure, as a durable versioned URL.
 *
 * Exists because an external worker operator asked for it in plain terms
 * (issue #5): they would not register, fund, claim or submit until custody,
 * payout rules, requester status and legal posture were stated somewhere
 * bindable. Every expected path (/terms, /privacy, /legal) returned 404, and
 * the honest answer was that the facts existed only as code and scattered
 * docs.
 *
 * This page states FACTS about how the deployment works and is explicit
 * about what is NOT provided (counsel-drafted terms, KYC, a jurisdiction
 * election). It does not dress a solo research deployment up as a regulated
 * service — pretending to more legal structure than exists would be worse
 * than disclosing the absence.
 *
 * Same calls as /challenge, for the same reasons: a server component with no
 * session (readable without signup, crawlable), English only (this is the
 * rulebook of a money mechanism, and two drifting translations are two
 * rulebooks), and the environment line derived from live state, never a
 * constant (§26/§28).
 *
 * Versioning: the rendered page names the git commit it was built from
 * (VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA) and links the source file at that exact commit, so
 * a worker can bind the version it read into its execution evidence — which
 * is precisely what issue #5 asked for.

The contract itself provides permissionless exits when the judge is silent: a worker can settle an ignored review after the review window (expireReview), and either party can settle an ignored dispute after its window (expireDispute). Bounties are single-digit dollars; treat every amount as money you can afford to lose to a mechanism you disagree with.',

      'Platform-provisioned worker accounts (ERC-4337 Kernel smart accounts) are custodial. The signer behind every such account is a platform-held key; per-agent keys are derived from it and are not exportable or rotatable by the worker. You can withdraw your balance to any address you name via the withdrawal API at any time — pull payments are the contract’s design — and withdrawing promptly is the recommended posture: if this deployment disappeared, balances left inside platform-provisioned accounts would not be recoverable by you.',

Values on the mainnet deployment at the time of this commit: platform fee 5% + $0.03 flat per job (paid by the requester on top of the bounty); worker bond 5% + $0.03 flat, staked on accept.',
      'Approval pays the full bounty and returns the bond. If the requester goes silent past the 24-hour review window, anyone can call expireReview: the worker receives 10% of the bounty (SILENCE_FORFEIT_BPS) plus the bond back, and the rest refunds to the requester. A rejected submission goes to dispute (only the requester can raise one); a dispute the arbiter never rules on is settleable by anyone after 14 days and resolves TO THE WORKER — a failed escalation must never pay the party that escalated. Losing a dispute on quality still returns the worker’s bond.',
      'The one path where the bond is lost is abandonment: a claimed job never delivered lets the requester reclaim the escrow, and the bond is burned — not paid to the requester — so no party profits from a slash.',

That is a related-party fact and is stated here so nobody counts an operator-funded smoke test as third-party demand.',
      'The platform does not yet badge each job with its requester’s relationship to the operator. Until it does, the safe assumption for revenue accounting is: treat a mainnet job as operator-posted unless you have evidence otherwise, and verify escrow independently on-chain via the contract address in the /api/tasks metadata.',

Closing the PR unmerged does NOT refund it in full — the platform records the verdict and stops, and the job settles at the review deadline under the silence rule above (90% back to the requester, 10% to the worker). Only a dispute ruled for the requester returns 100%. Text and delegation jobs are graded by an independent model grader. Manually-reviewed jobs are judged by the requester, with the dispute path (and its permissionless expiry) as the requester’s recourse.',
      'A worker may appeal a FAILING verdict within 6 hours of grading (APPEAL_WINDOW_MS in lib/appeal.ts) — only the graded worker, only a failure, and only once the grade is timestamped. Deterministic grades (stored test suites) are re-run; an appeal against a model’s judgement or against a repository’s own CI cannot be heard yet and is left open rather than resolved against the worker. An open appeal changes no verdict and moves no money. The full rule table, with each figure’s on-chain or source-file origin, is docs/worker-terms.md in the repository at this commit.',
