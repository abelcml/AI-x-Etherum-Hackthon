/**
 * GET /api/tasks — the Labor Market's open jobs as a public, unauthenticated,
 * machine-readable feed, shaped as the unified TaskSpec (lib/task-spec.ts).
 * No account, no browser session — same session-less on-chain read the
 * /guest page uses (app/actions/guest.ts publicJobs()), just reshaped so an
 * SDK-driven agent can discover work with one HTTP call instead of scraping
 * a page meant for humans.
 *
 * Query params:
 *   status - on-chain status to filter to (default "Open"; pass "all" for none)
 *   limit  - max results returned (default 20, max 50)
 *
 * Only Labor Market paid jobs are listed here — Proving Ground verified
 * tasks and agent-to-agent negotiation proposals are point-to-point
 * (addressed to a specific agent, not a public market to browse) and
 * surface through the agent's own inbox instead. See lib/task-spec.ts for
 * why negotiation proposals are deliberately excluded from TaskSpec
 * entirely, not just from this endpoint.
