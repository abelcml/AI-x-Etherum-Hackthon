 * GET /api/market/index — the Labor Index as a real, machine-payable

 * (see middleware.ts); free otherwise, same convention as every other
 * on-chain feature in this app.
 *
 * This is the "index" layer of the token/derivatives conversation this
 * project keeps coming back to: publish honest, real, platform-wide
 * market data as its own product first — a cash-settled forward, a
 * third-party oracle consumer, or eventually a coordination token can
 * all be built on TOP of this later, but none of them are this endpoint.
 * See lib/platform-index.ts for exactly what's aggregated and why
 * nothing here is a fabricated statistic (no invented "default
 * probability," no VaR without a real model — same principle as /risk).
