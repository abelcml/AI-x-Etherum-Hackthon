 * from the outside (the buttons are there or they are not), and making it
 * answerable in one request is what stops "why did GitHub sign-in disappear"
 * from needing a code reading.
 *
 * Every feature here is env-gated and degrades to silence when unconfigured,
 * which is correct and has one cost: a feature that is OFF looks exactly like a
 * feature that was never BUILT. On a fresh deployment that makes the whole
 * product look half-finished. This is the answer to that.
