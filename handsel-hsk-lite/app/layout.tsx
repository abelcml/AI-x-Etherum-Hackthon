 * Runs before paint so the theme applies without a flash.

 * The default is now decided by WHICH SITE the URL belongs to, because the
 * app has two jobs and one default cannot serve both. Public pages stay
 * light ("ledger paper") — a marketing page that opens black reads as a
 * developer tool to the first-time, non-technical visitor those pages exist
 * for. Everything behind the session check opens on the deck, the dark
 * navy-and-cyan console the 3D office is built from; an operations surface
 * that opens white reads as a form, and the diorama sitting in the middle of
 * it read as a screenshot pasted onto a different product.
 *
 * An explicit choice still wins in both directions and is remembered per
 * browser — this only changes what happens when there is no choice yet.
 * `lib/public-routes.ts` owns the classification and a test keeps it honest.
