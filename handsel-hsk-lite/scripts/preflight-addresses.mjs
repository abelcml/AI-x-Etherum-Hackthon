/**
 * The addresses that get welded into the contract, checked while they can still
 * be changed.
 *
 * `arbiter`, `feeRecipient`, `feeBps` and `flatFee` are all `immutable` in
 * LaborMarketV2 — written by the constructor, no setters. A wrong one is not a
 * config mistake, it is a redeploy, and if the market has taken money by then it
 * is a redeploy plus a migration.
 *
 * Two of these are the kind of wrong that looks perfectly fine:
 *
 *   - `ARBITER_ADDRESS` set to a wallet nobody signs with. There is no
 *     ARBITER_PRIVATE_KEY anywhere in this codebase; `resolveDispute` is signed
 *     by `oracleWallet()` (lib/onchain/labor.ts). So an arbiter that is not the
 *     oracle address makes every dispute unresolvable — and nothing reveals it
 *     until the first dispute, because posting, accepting and settling all work.
 *
 *   - `FEE_RECIPIENT` set to a contract that cannot call `withdraw()`. Fees are
 *     credited to `withdrawable[feeRecipient]` and pulled, never pushed, so an
 *     address that cannot make a call is an address that cannot be paid. The
 *     money accrues correctly and forever.
 *
 * Takes ADDRESSES, which are public. Never a private key.
 *
 *   ORACLE_ADDRESS=0x… ARBITER_ADDRESS=0x… FEE_RECIPIENT=0x… \
 *   DEPLOYER_ADDRESS=0x… node scripts/preflight-addresses.mjs
 *
 * `--rpc <url>` to use something other than the public Base endpoint.
