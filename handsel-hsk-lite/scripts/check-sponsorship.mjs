/**
 * Does this ZeroDev project actually sponsor on this chain?
 *
 * The runbook used to answer that at step 8, with a real job and real USDC, and
 * that is very late to learn the paymaster is unfunded or the project is pointed
 * at the wrong chain. Every question below can be asked before a single contract
 * is deployed:
 *
 *   1. which chain the bundler thinks it is on   (eth_chainId)
 *   2. which EntryPoint it will accept           (eth_supportedEntryPoints)
 *   3. whether the paymaster will price a real operation, for a real
 *      counterfactual Kernel account built the way the app builds one
 *
 * Step 3 is the one that matters. Reading the paymaster's EntryPoint deposit on
 * chain is NOT the same test — it read 0 for this deployment's paymaster while
 * the account balance was $10, because a provider may fund the deposit only as
 * it routes operations. A deposit of zero and a paymaster that is genuinely dry
 * look identical from chain state. Asking the paymaster to quote is the question
 * whose answer differs.
 *
 * Sends nothing, signs nothing, spends nothing. A quote is not an operation.
 *
 *   ZERODEV_RPC=https://rpc.zerodev.app/api/v3/<project>/chain/8453 \
 *   node scripts/check-sponsorship.mjs
 *
 * The sender is a Kernel v3.1 account derived from a key generated at run time
 * and never stored. It has never existed on chain, which is what makes the
 * answer meaningful: a project that prices an operation for an account it has
 * never seen is a project that will price one for a real agent.
 *
 * `--owner-key <key>` to derive a known kernel address instead, for a project
 * whose allowlist is already narrowed. `--rpc <url>` for a Base node other than
 * the public one.

   * can pay the EntryPoint's prefund, which is exactly what `AA21` says. If the

   * simulating the whole operation and accepting it.
