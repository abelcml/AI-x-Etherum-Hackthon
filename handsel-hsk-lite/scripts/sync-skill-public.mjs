/**
 * Publish the skill package to `public/`, so `install-skill.sh` has something
 * to download.
 *
 * The skill's canonical home is `skill/handsel/`, in the nested layout the
 * skills-market authoring standard requires. Next.js only serves files under
 * `public/`, so the served copy is a copy — and a copy is a drift hazard, which
 * this repo has now been bitten by often enough to stop hoping about
 * (§23 two receipts that read alike, §26 a doc asserting what the code did not
 * do).
 *
 * So the copy is generated, never hand-edited, and `tests/skill-package.test.ts`
 * fails the build when the two diverge. Run `npm run skill:sync` after touching
 * anything under `skill/`.
 *
 * It also writes the file list twice, on purpose. `manifest.json` is for tools
 * and humans; `files.txt` is newline-delimited for the installer, because
 * parsing JSON in POSIX sh is a bad trade — the first version tried, extracted
 * the wrong key, and only failed safely because the download step checks its
 * status. Both are generated from the same array, so they cannot disagree.
 *
 * Either way the installer carries no filenames of its own: a hardcoded list in
 * a shell script served from a CDN is the one place drift would be invisible
 * *and* remote.
