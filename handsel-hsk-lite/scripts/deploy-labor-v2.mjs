/**
 * Deploy LaborMarketV2.
 *
 * ## It deploys the COMMITTED artifact, and does not recompile
 *
 * `lib/onchain/labor-v2-artifact.ts` is checked in, and round 2 of the audit
 * verified it byte-identical to a fresh compile of the audited source. Any
 * deploy script that recompiles throws that away: the bytes that reach the
 * chain become whatever the local solc produced today, and "the deployed
 * contract is the audited contract" stops being checkable. So this reads the
 * artifact, prints its hash, and deploys exactly those bytes.
 *
 * ## Env
 *
 *   DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY   funded key that pays gas (0x…64 hex)
 *   ONCHAIN_RPC_URL        an RPC endpoint for the target chain
 *   ONCHAIN_CHAIN          base-sepolia (default) | base
 *   USDC_ADDRESS           the escrow token — REQUIRED, no default, ever
 *   CREDIT_REGISTRY_ADDRESS  a deployed AgentCreditRegistry
 *   ARBITER_ADDRESS        who may call resolveDispute
 *   FEE_RECIPIENT          where the posting fee accrues (only if fee > 0)
 *
 * Config overrides, all optional — the defaults are the recommended FIRST
 * mainnet deployment and are deliberately conservative:
 *
 *   FEE_BPS=0              proportional fee, scales with the value at risk
 *   FLAT_FEE=0             flat fee in TOKEN UNITS — this is what covers gas
 *   BOND_BPS=0             proportional bond
 *   FLAT_BOND=0            flat bond in TOKEN UNITS — what makes accept cost something
 *   REVIEW_WINDOW_S        default 1 day, not 7 — jobs here finish in minutes
 *   MAX_OPEN_WINDOW_S, DISPUTE_WINDOW_S, MIN/MAX_DELIVERY_WINDOW_S, MIN_BOUNTY
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/deploy-labor-v2.mjs
 *       node scripts/deploy-labor-v2.mjs --confirm-mainnet     (for base)
