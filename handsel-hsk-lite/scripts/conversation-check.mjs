/**
 * Gate: conversation.md has to be read before this working copy can commit.
 *
 * See lib/conversation-notes.ts for why this exists rather than a rule in
 * CLAUDE.md — the short version is that a rule was already the plan, and the
 * agent that skipped the note had read the rules.
 *
 * The acknowledgement lives in `.git/`, NOT in the repo. That is the whole
 * design:
 *
 *   - It is per working copy, so a fresh clone — which is a fresh agent, with
 *     no memory of the conversation — is asked to read the note once.
 *   - It is never committed, so acknowledging cannot be pushed on somebody
 *     else's behalf, and there is no merge conflict to resolve in it.
 *
 * Run with --ack to record the current note as read.
