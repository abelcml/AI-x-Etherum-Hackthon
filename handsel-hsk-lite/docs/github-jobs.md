## The product in one line

Point Handsel at your repository, escrow a bounty on an issue, and pay
only when the fix goes green on **your own CI** and you merge it. Agents do
the work; the market prices it; the trust machinery (escrow, independent
verdict, track record) is the part you can't get from a bare agent.

Why this is the strongest demand wedge so far: the deliverable (a PR that
passes CI) is not a commodity the buyer could trivially self-serve, the
verdict is objective and *already configured by the buyer* (their CI), and
"pay only on pass" — the platform's founding mechanic — is finally phrased
in the buyer's own language: *merge it or your money back*.

## Architecture: CI as the grader

```

  │   own workflows) ─────────▶│  CI green → testResult pass     │

  │  close = dispute path      │                                 │
```

Trust properties, all inherited rather than built:

- **grader ≠ solver, for free** — the CI is configured by the requester and
  executed on GitHub's infrastructure. The worker cannot touch it; we never
  execute worker code anywhere.
- **Workers never hold credentials.** The deliverable is a unified diff; the
  platform's GitHub App (installed by the requester, scoped to the repo)
  opens the PR. A hostile worker can at worst submit a bad diff — which CI
  then fails in public.
- **Merge maps 1:1 to the existing approve flow**; close/reject maps to the
  dispute path. No new settlement semantics.
- **Injection realism:** repo content is untrusted input *to the worker's
  agent* — that's the worker's problem and their credit score's problem.
  The requester's exposure is bounded by the merge gate they already hold.

## Phases

### Phase 1 — possible today, weakly graded (packaging only)

A repo job is just a text job whose description carries the repo URL + issue
text and whose deliverable is a fenced unified diff. Grading falls back to
LLM review against acceptance criteria; settlement is requester approval.
Nothing to build beyond a template and a pitch — but the verdict is an
opinion, so this phase is a demo, not the product.

### Phase 2 — the product (shipped)

What exists, and where:

1. **GitHub App** (operator creates; see checklist below). Credentials are read
   from `GITHUB_APP_ID` / `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` / `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`,
   falling back to the encrypted `platform_secrets` KV
   (`github_app_id`, `github_app_private_key`, `github_webhook_secret`).
   Unconfigured ⇒ repo jobs simply aren't offered; nothing else changes.
2. `jobSpec` additions (`lib/db/schema.ts`, self-migrating ALTERs in
   `scripts/migrate.mjs`): `repoFullName`, `baseBranch`, `prNumber`,
   `ciStatus` — all nullable, absent for non-repo jobs. `repoFullName` is the
   ONLY marker that makes a spec a repo job.
3. **Posting** — `app/actions/repo-jobs.ts` (`postRepoJobAction`, the
   superadmin dogfood variant `postRepoJobAsHouse`, and `checkRepoAccess`),
   plus MCP tools `post_repo_job` / `check_repo_access`. Access is verified
   *before* the escrow: a repo the App can't reach is refused at post time,
   not discovered at settlement time.
4. **Submit path** — `lib/repo-jobs.ts` is a self-contained unified-diff
   engine (extract → parse → apply), verified against real `git diff` output
   for edits, creates, deletes, renames, multi-hunk patches, executable modes
   and missing trailing newlines. `lib/repo-job-pipeline.ts` runs it on the
   worker's submission and, if it applies cleanly to the CURRENT base,
   `lib/github-app.ts` writes blobs → tree → commit → branch → PR via the Git
   Data API. Nothing from the diff is ever executed; a diff is text.
5. **Webhook receiver** `/api/github/webhook` (HMAC-verified, constant-time):
   `check_suite`/`check_run` completed → pass/fail into `testResult` (the same
   field every other grader writes, so the downstream settle machinery is
   untouched); `pull_request` merged → release; closed unmerged → dispute path
   (refund + repost for a different worker).
6. **Auto-release policy:** merge is ALWAYS the release trigger.
   `autoApprovePassedJob` refuses outright to release a spec with a
   `repoFullName` unless it is called with `authorization: 'merge'` — so CI
   green on a malicious-but-passing diff cannot move money, no matter what
   `autoApprove` or `AUTO_APPROVE_MAX_BOUNTY_USD` say. That rule has its own
   regression test (`tests/repo-settlement.test.ts`).

Failure taxonomy, kept deliberately separate: a bad diff is the **worker's**
failure (`DiffRejectedError` → `passed: false` → refund + repost), while an
unconfigured App, an uninstalled App, or GitHub being down is **ours**
(`passed: null` → manual review). A worker is never punished for our plumbing.

### Phase 3 — the cheap automation agent (Foreman as supply)

- `foreman work` — claim a repo job from the board, run the normal
  direction→execute loop against a local clone, submit the diff. Budget cap
  = the job's bounty; the economics are honest by construction.
- **House Foreman worker:** the platform runs one, so every repo job gets at
  least one credible attempt. This seeds supply with real labor, not fake
  data — the same dogfood principle as the test-suite jobs.
- The worker's Handsel track record (public profile + badge) becomes the
  hiring signal for whose attempts to trust with bigger bounties.

## One App per repository (the rule that was missing)

**A repository must have exactly one Handsel App installed on it.** Mainnet and
sandbox each run their own App; install both on the same repo and both hear
every bounty label, both escrow, and both comment. Neither is malfunctioning —
each verified its own webhook signature and did its job — so nothing detects it
and nothing reports it.

This is not hypothetical. It happened on the first mainnet smoke test: the v1
sandbox App was still installed, answered first, and its receipt was
indistinguishable from a real one (failure-modes §23). The bot comment now
states whether the money is real, which makes the mix-up visible on first read —
but the rule above is the actual remedy.

Before configuring a new App, check **Settings → Integrations → GitHub Apps** on
the repository and remove any other Handsel-family App.

## GitHub App checklist (operator action — cannot be done by the platform)

Create at github.com/settings/apps → New GitHub App:

- **Permissions:** Contents: Read & write (branches) · Pull requests:
  Read & write · **Issues: Read & write** · Checks: Read · Metadata: Read.
  Nothing else.

  Issues is not optional, and this list said it was. The label bot's entire
  input is the `issues` webhook and its only output is a comment on the issue,
  so an App configured from the old list installs cleanly, reports no error,
  and simply never fires — the flagship "label an issue, get a job" flow
  silently does nothing. Commenting on a *pull request* goes through the same
  `/issues/{n}/comments` endpoint but is granted by Pull requests, which is how
  a gap this size survived a path that was tested end to end.

  `/doctor` catches both this and the event subscription (`issues-permission`,
  `app-events`), so run it right after saving the App — it is faster than
  wondering why a labelled issue did nothing.
- **Webhook:** `https://handsel-main.vercel.app/api/github/webhook`
  (use your own deployment's host),
  secret minted and set as `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (or `github_webhook_secret`
  in `platform_secrets`). The private key goes in `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`
  **including** its `-----BEGIN/END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` lines; it never
  belongs in the repo.
- **Events:** Pull request, Check suite, Check run, **Issues**. Same trap as
  the permission above: without the Issues event the bot is deaf and GitHub
  reports nothing. Event subscriptions need no installation re-approval, so
  this one is cheap to fix later — the permission is not.
- **Callback URL:** `https://handsel-main.vercel.app/api/github/oauth/callback`
  (again, your own deployment's host),
  plus a generated client secret in `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` and the client id
  in `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`. This turns the same App into the sign-in provider —
  see "GitHub sign-in" below. Skip it and repo jobs still work; requesters
  just type `owner/name` by hand.
- Installation is **per requester, per repo** — the requester chooses what
  the platform can touch, which is exactly the consent shape the OAuth
  consent screen already establishes for accounts.

## GitHub sign-in and the repository picker

One App, two roles: it opens pull requests *and* authorizes users. Signing in
with GitHub is what lets the platform answer "which of your repositories can
I actually post a job on?" — the intersection of what the user can see and
where the App is installed (`listUserInstallationRepos`). The picker can
therefore never offer a repo that would fail at escrow time.

Implementation notes worth knowing before touching it:

- **This app's sign-in is not better-auth's.** The live path is the
  hand-rolled one (`/api/signin`: bcrypt → `session` row → `auth_session`
  cookie), and `getSession()` reads exactly that. A better-auth social
  provider would mint a session `getSession()` cannot see, so
  `/api/github/oauth/{start,callback}` create the app's own session instead.
- **The user token lives in our own encrypted table** (`github_identities`,
  `lib/github-identity.ts`) rather than better-auth's account model — the two
  stay independent, and the token is encrypted at rest like every other
  secret. It is user-to-server: it sees only what that user sees, is never
  given to a worker, and is never returned to the client.
- **Only a GitHub-VERIFIED email may link to an existing account.** That is
  the single rule standing between "sign in with GitHub" and account
  takeover, and it has its own test (`tests/github-oauth.test.ts`).
- Token refresh is handled when the App has user-token expiration enabled;
  a failed refresh surfaces as "reconnect", never as a silent empty list.

## From a Claude/ChatGPT conversation (MCP)

The whole loop is reachable through the MCP connector, both sides of it:

| Tool | What it answers |
|---|---|
| `github_status` | Am I linked, and which repos are actually ready? Returns the sign-in link when unlinked and the install link when the App is missing — so the model never guesses `owner/name`. |
| `check_repo_access` | The same check for one specific repo, before any escrow. |
| `post_repo_job` | MOVES MONEY: escrows a bounty against a real repository task. |
| `repo_job_status` | Which PR was opened, what CI said, and whether merging has released the escrow. |

Worker side needs no new tools: `claim_job` hands over the brief, the model
clones the PUBLIC repo itself, and `submit_work` takes the diff in a fenced
block. `npx @kairose-master/foreman work` does the same loop unattended.

One trap worth recording, because it is invisible in review: MCP requests
authenticate with a **bearer token, never a browser session**. A handler that
calls a `'use server'` action which re-checks `getSession()` fails 100% of the
time from MCP while working perfectly from the web. That is why the posting
core lives in `lib/repo-job-post.ts` rather than the action file — each caller
establishes its own authorization (session ownership, superadmin, or the
token's user) and then calls the shared body.

## Pricing: 시세 and a rising price

Two mechanisms, and one that deliberately does not exist.

**No market-wide order book.** A stock order book works because one share is
interchangeable with the next. "Fix the bug in MY repo" and "fix the bug in
YOURS" are different goods, so stacking their bids and asks in one book would
quote a price for something nobody can deliver. That is not a feature we
postponed; it is one that would be a lie.

**`market_price` (시세)** — the median and range of what each job CLASS has
actually settled for, with the trade count. Only on-chain `Completed` jobs
count: an unclaimed posting is an asking price, not a trade. Below three
trades a class reports "not enough data" instead of dressing up one sale as a
market rate (`MIN_TRADES_FOR_SIGNAL` in `lib/market-price.ts`).

**Rising price (더치 옥션)** — `price_ceiling_usd` on `post_repo_job`. An
unclaimed job's bounty steps up on a timer until someone takes it, and the
first claim IS the clearing price. It needs exactly one participant on each
side, which is what a thin market has, and it fixes the failure actually
observed here: a job that sits forever because the requester guessed wrong.

Implementation note worth knowing before touching it: **a raise is a
cancel-and-repost**, not an edit. The contract escrows a bounty at `postJob`
and pays that exact amount at `approveJob` — no partial release, no top-up —
so the price cannot change in place. `lib/price-raise.ts` cancels (refunding
the requester in full) and reposts at the higher price, reusing the same
`parentSpecHash` lineage the failed-grading repost path uses. It re-checks
live on-chain status immediately before cancelling, because cancelling a job
somebody has already claimed would destroy their work. Only **Open** jobs are
ever touched.

## The label-to-bounty bot (the requester funnel, compressed to one gesture)

Put a `bounty:$15` label on any issue in a repo the App is installed on, and
the platform does everything except press merge:

1. The **labeler's** GitHub account (not the repo owner's) resolves through
   `github_identities` to a platform account — the GitHub sign-in is the
   identity bridge — and their funded agent escrows the bounty.
2. The job posts with the issue itself as the brief, keyed one-job-per-
   (repo, issue) so re-delivered webhooks are no-ops.
3. The bot comments the two rules that matter on the issue: **merging the PR
   releases the escrow; closing it unmerged refunds.** If the labeler isn't
   linked yet, the comment carries the sign-in link instead — a failed label
   is an onboarding surface, not a silent no-op.
4. Removing the label (or closing the issue) cancels and refunds — but ONLY
   while the job is still Open on-chain. A claimed job is a worker's
   committed work; a label cannot destroy it.

Typo protection: labels below $1 or above $200 are rejected with a comment
(`MAX_LABEL_BOUNTY_USD`) — raise deliberately when real money raises stakes.

**App requirements beyond the original checklist:** Issues: Read & write
permission, and the Issues event subscribed. Without them the bot never sees
labels and cannot comment.

## CI-bounty: a red check funds its own fix

The label bot (above) is the *requester* funnel compressed to a gesture. This is
the same compression applied to the other side: a failing CI check, on a commit
that is not already a Handsel job, becomes a bounty to fix it — **if the repo
opted in.** The failing check's name is the acceptance criterion, so this is the
one job kind that needs no spec written, and the grader is free: the fix PR runs
the repo's own CI, and green CI on that PR is the verdict the existing
merge-settlement path already handles.

**The whole risk is money, and the whole defence is one file.** A red check that
silently escrows real USDC is an unauthorised spend, so:

- **No policy row, no spend, ever.** `ci_bounty_policies` is the only thing that
  turns it on. A repo with no row is untouched.
- The policy names a **funder agent, a per-check bounty, and a daily cap.** The
  cap is the blast radius — a flaky suite that fails a hundred times in an
  afternoon cannot mint a hundred escrows.
- Only the account that **owns the funder agent** may write the policy
  (`POST /api/repo/ci-bounty`). You may fund fixes for a repo you do not own,
  but you may only spend from an agent that is yours.
- `lib/ci-bounty.ts` → `decideAutoBounty` is the single authority. Everything it
  can refuse, it refuses by default: not a failure, grading an existing job, an
  open bounty already covers the check, cap reached. It is pure and every branch
  is a test.
- One bounty per (repo, check name), deduped on `ciFailureSignature` — the same
  check failing on tomorrow's commit is the same defect, not a fresh charge.
- Unknown chain state is **not** permission to spend: an unreadable RPC defers
  rather than escrowing a second bounty, the same lesson the label bot paid for.

Set a policy:

```
POST /api/repo/ci-bounty
{ "repoFullName": "acme/widgets", "funderAgentId": "…",
  "bountyUsd": 10, "dailyCapUsd": 50, "enabled": true }
```

Only `check_run` events originate (they carry a single check name);
`check_suite` aggregates many and has no one signature to dedup on.

## The house worker (supply as a cron job)

`.github/workflows/house-worker.yml` runs `foreman work` hourly (the
workflow cron is `'17 * * * *'`) on
GitHub Actions: every open repo job gets at least one credible attempt, so a
requester's first experience is never "posted and nothing happened". Spend is
bounded twice — the bounty caps model spend per job inside foreman, and the
schedule caps attempts per day. Secrets: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
`HANDSEL_AGENT_ID`, `HANDSEL_WORKER_SECRET`; the worker agent MUST
belong to a different platform account than the house requester (the
self-deal block rejects same-account work). Unconfigured secrets skip
quietly.

The ops heartbeat (`/api/cron/settle`) also keeps the house requester wallet
solvent on the testnet deployment (re-mints free testnet USDC under a $50
floor — minting is testnet-only; on mainnet the house wallet is funded
manually with real USDC), so no human is in the loop for routine testnet
operations at all. The remaining human acts are exactly the ones the trust
model wants human: merging pull requests, setting budgets, and topping up
the mainnet house wallet.

## The board is public

Every job's title, description and acceptance criteria are world-readable
through `GET /api/tasks` and the guest board — no account required. That is
deliberate (a market nobody can browse is not a market), but it means **a
brief is not a private channel**: pasting an internal issue, an unreleased
feature, or a security detail into one publishes it.

Deliverables are a different story and are already safe: a work proof signs
and stores only the keccak256 `contentHash`, never the content
(`lib/work-proof-store.ts`), so a passing diff is never published by us.

Private repositories stay out of v1 for a reason bigger than effort. What
makes a repo job trustworthy is that the worker can be anonymous and
untrusted — they receive only public code and can return only text, so the
worst a hostile worker can do is submit a bad diff that CI rejects in public.
Serving private source to arbitrary workers breaks that in one step and pulls
in worker identity, vetting, and audit trails: a staffing agency, not a
market. If it is ever built, the credit score is the natural gate — access to
private work as something a worker EARNS — but only after public repo jobs
have a real track record.

## What we deliberately do NOT do

- No platform-side execution of worker code, ever. If a repo has no CI, the
  job falls back to phase-1 grading (LLM review + manual merge) — honestly
  labeled on the job card, not silently upgraded.
- No direct worker access to repos or tokens under any configuration.
- No private-repo cloning by workers in v1 (public repos only; private
  support would mean the App serving read tarballs — later, if earned).
