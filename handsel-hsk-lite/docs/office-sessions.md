# Office sessions — the unit past one job

*2026-09-03. The runtime that turns an office from a roster into an
organisation that pursues a goal over time: plans it, hands the work to a
coding harness on the owner's machine (or to the market), watches it,
checkpoints it, verifies what came back, pays what a written policy allows,
asks a person for the rest, and resumes after a crash from the last safe
point. Read `docs/office.md` first; this is what the office DOES with its
roster.*

Not to be confused with `docs/sessions.md` (`lib/session.ts`), which is a
thread of escrowed turns bound to one worker — a job that lasts an hour. An
office session is a goal that lasts as long as it takes and can contain many
jobs.

## The model

```

        ├── SessionRun         one execution of a task on one worker (attempt N)
        ├── Checkpoint         what a run had done — summary, git HEAD, bounded patch, files

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `lib/office-session.ts` | statuses, transition table, event vocabulary, the reducer (`applyEvent`, `replay`), invariants |
| `lib/office-session-loop.ts` | one heartbeat as a pure function: `tickSession(state, observation, policy) → { events, commands }`; worker selection; `learnFromSession` |
| `lib/approval-policy.ts` | the approval engine: hard rules, the owner's rules as JSON, risk tiers E0–E4, the money gate |
| `lib/coding-harness.ts` | the `CodingHarness` contract; Claude Code's grant → argv and stream parser; the session brief; workspace boundary; redaction |
| `lib/office-session-plan.ts` | the default plan (no model needed) and the mapping from the delegation planner's JSON |

| `app/api/worker/poll/route.ts`, `app/api/worker/session-run/route.ts` | the run hand-out, progress reports and cancel list ride the existing poll; the finish report has its own route |
| `public/handsel-worker.mjs` | `runSessionRun`: spawn under the grant (brief on stdin), stream, checkpoint on the first edit and every minute, report-only polls while busy, verify, collect the diff, report |

### Relationship to jobs and delegations

A job stays what it is: one deliverable, one `specHash`, one release. A
session task with `settlement: 'escrow'` IS a job — posted by
`postSpecJob` with `autoApprove` **off**, graded and paid by the paths every
job uses. The session only decides *when* `autoApprove` may flip on: after
the policy said ALLOW, `settle_escrow` sets the flag and calls
`autoApprovePassedJob`, the single release site, whose on-chain status
check, peer-review hold and cap all still apply. There is no second place
money leaves from.

A task with `settlement: 'internal'` is the office's own worker on the
owner's own machine. No escrow is posted, no bounty exists, no credit event
is written (self-dealing must not inflate a score — `docs/failure-modes.md`
invariant 22). Settling it records the decision and the artifact hash.

A delegation is what a session's `plan` command produces when the goal is
for the market and a model key is configured: the delegation planner's JSON
maps onto escrow tasks (`planFromSubtasks`). Without a key, or for a local
coding session, the plan is deterministic: one task, the goal, verified by
the owner's command and an independent review.

## Session kinds

| kind | what the loop does |
|---|---|
| `one_shot` | plan once, run to completion |
| `long_running` | same, over hours or days — heartbeats, checkpoints, resume |
| `scheduled` | after a wave completes, `WAKE_SCHEDULED` at the next fire; on wake, `WAVE_STARTED` and a fresh plan. The schedule is the SAME session's repeated run, not a new session |
| `event_driven` | a trigger is `TRIGGER_RECEIVED` the moment it fires — paused, mid-wave, whatever — into `pendingTriggers`; once the wave is done, `WAVE_STARTED` carries that list and clears it. A trigger that lands mid-wave is queued, never dropped (§71) |
| `event_driven` | idle after a wave (`nextWakeAt = null`); `fireSessionTrigger(userId, 'github.ci_failed')` wakes it with a new wave |
| `local_coding` | bound to one local worker and its workspace grant; the default plan is one coding task |

## The state machine

Generated from the code (`transitionTableMarkdown()`), so this table and the
reducer cannot disagree:

| status | shown to the owner | may go to | money may move | automatable |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `draft` | Goal recorded; nothing has been planned yet. | planned, paused, cancelled, expired, failed | no | yes |
| `planned` | The plan exists; the budget has not been checked against it. | awaiting_budget, ready, … | no | yes |
| `awaiting_budget` | The plan costs more than the session may spend. | planned, ready, … | no | **no** |
| `ready` | Work is ready to dispatch. | planned, running, waiting_on_*, retrying, completed, partially_completed, … | **yes** | yes |
| `running` | A worker is executing a task right now. | ready, waiting_on_*, retrying, completed, partially_completed, … | **yes** | yes |
| `waiting_on_dependency` | Every remaining task is blocked on one that has not finished. | ready, running, completed, partially_completed, … | no | yes |
| `waiting_on_worker` | The worker went silent; the last checkpoint is preserved and a resume is pending. | running, retrying, ready, partially_completed, … | no | yes |
| `waiting_on_review` | A deliverable is in; an independent reviewer has not answered. | ready, running, waiting_on_approval, retrying, … | no | yes |
| `waiting_on_approval` | The policy could not decide alone; a person has to approve or deny. | ready, running, retrying, completed, partially_completed, … | no | **no** |
| `paused` | Paused by the owner; nothing is dispatched until resumed. | ready, cancelled, expired, failed | no | **no** |
| `retrying` | The last attempt failed; the next one is scheduled. | running, ready, waiting_on_worker, waiting_on_dependency, failed, partially_completed, … | no | yes |
| `partially_completed` | Finished with some tasks not done. | — | no | — |
| `completed` | Every task settled. | — | no | — |
| `failed` / `cancelled` / `expired` | terminal, reason on record | — | no | — |

Every non-terminal status may pause, cancel, expire or fail. `STATUS_META`
also carries, per status, what the next heartbeat does and what a fresh
process does after a restart.

### Invariants (`sessionInvariants`)

Checked in tests after every event of every scenario, and by `appendEvents`
before every commit — a batch that would violate one is refused whole:

- a `completed` session has no open escrow task and no failed task (that is `partially_completed`);
- a `cancelled` session has told every live run to stop;
- a terminal session names no current run and has no wake scheduled;
- a `running` session has a current run that is live (or just finished and about to be folded), and that run is resumable: it wrote a checkpoint, began from one, or its task has none (the brief is the level-0 checkpoint);
- `waiting_on_approval` cannot move money and has an undecided approval;
- spend never exceeds the budget; a task never exceeds its attempts; a task is never dispatched twice at once;
- an escrow task settles only after `PAYMENT_SETTLED`; any task settles only after a granted approval;
- money never moves under a `DENY`, and a `REQUIRE_OWNER`/`REQUIRE_REVIEWER` approval is never decided by the policy.

### Time

Every event carries `occurredAt`; the session carries `startedAt`,
`lastHeartbeatAt`, `nextWakeAt`, `deadlineAt`, `pausedAt`, `completedAt`. The
loop schedules its own next wake (`WAKE_SCHEDULED`): a minute while a run
is live, five while waiting on the world, the retry time while backing
off, the deadline whenever it is sooner. The ops step ticks every session
whose `nextWakeAt` has passed.

## The loop (`tickSession`)

```
observe      the server folds worker reports, chain reads, review answers into EVENTS first
interpret    terminal? deadline? paused? — then time out silent runs (heartbeat, pickup, wall clock)
plan         draft → `plan` command; planned → BUDGET_CHECKED
retry/fail   a task whose run died: RETRY_SCHEDULED with backoff, or TASK_FAILED when attempts are spent
graph        doomed tasks skipped, unblocked tasks ready, the rest blocked
verify       submitted → tests (deterministic) → independent review → decide
decide       evaluateApproval → ALLOW / ALLOW_WITH_LOG (granted by policy) · REQUIRE_OWNER (waits) · DENY (fails)
settle       internal → TASK_SETTLED; escrow → moneyGate → PAYMENT_AUTHORIZED + `settle_escrow`, settled when the chain says paid
dispatch     one live run per workspace; selectWorker; TASK_DISPATCHED + `dispatch_run` (with the checkpoint to resume from)
learn        on completion: `record_memory` — lessons derived from the record, folded into the office's session memory
schedule     WAKE_SCHEDULED
```

Every stage's output is an event the reducer accepted or a command the
server performs; a command's result arrives as events on the next append,
so a crash between the two leaves a resumable record.

### Verification layers, and what each may authorise

| layer | evidence | may |
|---|---|---|
| deterministic test (`verify.command`, run by the worker after the harness) | exit code + tail, `TEST_REPORTED` | a failure DENIES outright; a pass is one condition |
| platform grader (escrow tasks) | the job's recorded verdict | a recorded FAIL is never re-graded into a pass (§69) |
| independent reviewer (model, `run_review`) | `REVIEW_RECEIVED {approve, note}` | REVISE with attempts left → feedback and a retry; APPROVE is one condition; no reviewer available → a person |
| the policy | the flattened evidence | ALLOW / ALLOW_WITH_LOG / REQUIRE_OWNER / REQUIRE_REVIEWER / DENY |
| the owner | the inbox | anything the policy could not |
| the chain | `PAYMENT_SETTLED` observed, never assumed | settles an escrow task |

## The approval policy (`lib/approval-policy.ts`)

Not a boolean. Two layers, in order:

1. **Hard rules** no policy can relax: a write outside the workspace → DENY;
   over the remaining or daily budget → DENY; failed tests or CI → DENY;
   risk **E4** (money, deploy, delete, production), a modified secret,
   production impact, or over the single-task limit → **REQUIRE_OWNER**.
2. **The owner's rules**, as JSON: `deny` (any) · `requireOwner` (any) ·
   `requireReviewer` (any, while unreviewed) · `autoApprove` (ALL). A
   condition on evidence that is missing never holds — "no test ran" is not
   "tests passed".

The default policy is the product spec's example:

```
daily_budget_usd: 20 · single_task_limit_usd: 3
auto_approve: testsPassed != false · changedFileCount <= 10 · secretModified == false · productionImpact == false · reviewerVerdict == APPROVE · amountUsd <= 2
require_owner: amountUsd > 2 · productionImpact · newDependency · reviewerDisagreement
require_reviewer: reviewerVerdict == null
```

Every decision is a receipt on the `ApprovalRecord`: policy id and version,
the evidence read (verbatim), the rules that matched, one reason per
line, who decided (`policy` | `owner` | `reviewer`), and what moved.

**Risk tiers** (`riskTierFor`, from what a run actually did): E0 read ·
E1 edit in workspace · E2 tests/shell · E3 network/install/PR/dependency ·
E4 money/deploy/delete/production. Same letters as
`lib/evidence-assurance.ts`'s evidence classes, deliberately not the same
ladder: one says how much a claim may be trusted, the other how much an
action can do.

**The money gate** (`moneyGate`): an escrow release is asked for only from
a status whose `moneyMayMove` is true, under ALLOW/ALLOW_WITH_LOG or a
person's grant, and — on a real-money deployment — a **policy** decision
needs `OFFICE_SESSION_ALLOW_REAL_MONEY=true` (the LINEAGE / REVIEW_STAKE
shape). An owner's own click is not gated by the flag. Internal tasks pass
for the record and move nothing.

## Claude Code as a first-class worker

### The contract (`CodingHarness`)

`detect → preflight → start → stream → pause/resume/cancel → collect →
inspectWorkspace`. Only `claude` gets the full treatment today
(`HARNESS_SESSION_SUPPORT`): a structured stream (`--output-format
stream-json --verbose`), native session ids, and the grant compiled to tool
allow/deny lists. Codex, OpenCode, Cline and Gemini run a session under
their one-shot argv with the brief on the command line, report line-buffered
stdout, and resume from checkpoints only. That is stated per adapter, not
implied.

### The grant → the flags

```
write:false   → --permission-mode plan  + --disallowedTools Edit,Write,MultiEdit,NotebookEdit
write:true    → --permission-mode acceptEdits          (edits auto-approved INSIDE the cwd only)
shell:true    → --allowedTools Bash      shell:false → --disallowedTools Bash
network:false → --disallowedTools WebFetch,WebSearch
```

Never `bypassPermissions` on a session run. `acceptEdits` auto-approves
edits inside the working directory and nothing else, so a write outside it
needs an answer no headless run can give and fails closed. The platform
checks the reported paths against the workdir anyway (`escapedWorkspace` →
a hard DENY); and the worker refuses a grant whose workdir lies outside its
own `--workdir`. The mirror in `public/handsel-worker.mjs` is pinned to
`lib/coding-harness.ts` by `tests/coding-harness.test.ts`, which extracts
and runs it.

### Connect once

```
Office → Worker fleet → "Connect Claude Code on your machine"
  choose agent · working directory · verification command · shell / network / install / push · $ per task · $ per day
  → connectWorkspaceWorker(): flips the agent to a local worker (rotating its secret), stores the grant, returns ONE command
  → npx handsel-worker --token … --workdir <dir> --harness claude
  → first poll: the worker is online; a session's task can be dispatched to it
```

Secrets and external payments are never grantable from that surface.

### While it runs

The worker parses the stream into events (`progress`, `file`, `tool`,
`error`, `cost`), redacts credential shapes, and sends them on the next poll
(`session_runs`) — the same authenticated round trip that hands out work.
Every 60 s it captures a checkpoint: `git status`, a bounded `git diff`
(untracked files included), the last thing the harness said. The platform
folds each report into `RUN_PROGRESS` and each checkpoint into
`CHECKPOINT_CREATED`; the raw lines go to a bounded run log the page
tails.

On exit the worker runs the verification command (when `shell` is granted),
takes the diff and the changed/deleted file list from git, reads the
deliverable file the brief named, and POSTs `/api/worker/session-run`. The
server hashes the diff, deliverable and test report as artifacts, folds
`RUN_FINISHED` + `TASK_SUBMITTED` + `TEST_REPORTED`, and ticks the session
immediately so verification starts now.

### When it dies (scenario B)

No heartbeat for `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MS` (5 min; `OFFICE_SESSION_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MS`
to tune, bounded) → `RUN_TIMED_OUT` → `waiting_on_worker`, the checkpoint
kept. `RETRY_SCHEDULED` with backoff; on the retry the task is dispatched
again with `resumedFromCheckpointId`, the brief carries the checkpoint's
summary and files, and the worker re-applies the checkpoint's patch when the
working tree no longer has it. Attempts are counted per task, so a resume is
attempt 2 of the same task — never a second task, never a second payment.
A run nobody picked up within `PICKUP_TIMEOUT_MS` is `WORKER_LOST`; another
alive worker is chosen if there is one, otherwise the session waits and the
owner is told.

## What the worker enforces vs what the platform records

| boundary | enforced by | recorded by |
|---|---|---|
| the working directory | `cwd` + `acceptEdits`; the worker refuses a grant outside its `--workdir` | `escapedWorkspace` on the reported files → DENY |
| shell / network / editing tools | Claude Code's allow/deny lists | the stream's tool events → `runRiskTier` |
| secrets | never granted; `.env*`/keys in the changed files → `secretModified` | hard REQUIRE_OWNER |
| production / dependencies | — | path classes → `productionImpact` / `newDependency` |
| cost | per-task and daily limits in the grant and the policy | `PAYMENT_SETTLED` sums per office per 24 h |

## The control room (`/office/sessions`)

**First screen first.** `components/office-control-strip.tsx` sits at the
top of the dashboard home and of `/office`: needs-you count with inline
approve/deny, live sessions with their current task, worker and next step,
running-now, workers online, paid today (and how much of it the policy
approved by itself), retries/failures, the latest artifact by hash, and how
many lessons the briefs opened with. Every number is the same
`officeSessionOverview` query the control room uses; it links into it.

Needs your decision (the inbox: reasons, files, the diff, approve/deny) →
Sessions (status sentence, wave, tasks done, spent/budget, live runs, next
check; pause/resume/cancel) → Worker fleet (grant, liveness, harness;
connect) → Budget (paid today, of which auto-approved; committed) → Give
the office a goal → Approval policy (rendered; editable as JSON) → What
this office learned. `/office/sessions/<id>`: the timeline (the log,
verbatim), the live run (the harness's own lines), tasks with every
verdict, approvals with the evidence they were decided on, artifacts by
hash, and whether replaying the log reproduces the state shown.

## The end-to-end scenario

`scripts/office-session-e2e.ts` runs against a scratch Postgres, the real
`next start`, the real `handsel-worker.mjs` and a real `claude` process, on
a git fixture whose `add()` subtracts. It creates the user and agent rows
sign-up would create, stores a grant, starts a session, and drives the loop
by ticking; the worker does what a worker does. What it checks: only the
intended file changed, the diff and test report were stored by hash, the
policy decided as written, the event log replays to the materialized state,
and — for scenario B — that killing the worker mid-run ends in a resumed
attempt 2 from the checkpoint and one settlement, not two.

### What the run that shipped with this document showed (2026-09-03)

Environment: this repo's container, Postgres 16 on a scratch cluster,
`next start` on port 3111, `handsel-worker.mjs --harness claude
--no-preflight` (root: the one-shot preflight asks for
`bypassPermissions`, which the CLI refuses under root; session runs use
`acceptEdits` and are unaffected), Claude Code 2.1.259, no LLM key on the
platform (so no independent reviewer).

| scenario | sessions | what happened |
|---|---|---|
| **A** local coding, default policy | `oses-ImdcSVsh5VZy` | plan → dispatch → Claude Code edited `lib/math.js` only, ran `npm test` (pass), wrote the deliverable → diff/deliverable/test report stored by sha256 → review requested, **no reviewer available** → `REQUIRE_OWNER`, session `waiting_on_approval` → owner granted on the inbox → settled, `completed`. Harness cost $0.0886. Replay matched the materialized state. |
| **C** small task, lenient policy (no reviewer condition) | `oses-yXXZCd1Bw9tt` | same run; policy evaluated `ALLOW_WITH_LOG` (tests pass, 1 file, no secret, no production, $0) → granted by policy, settled, `completed` with nobody clicking. |
| **B** worker killed mid-run | `oses-s_Mylv5n9SHy` (no checkpoint yet), **`oses-ajSaGQAr9qcZ`** (checkpoint) | `kill -9` on the worker 12 s in, after the first edit's checkpoint (patch 291 B) had landed → 45 s later `RUN_TIMED_OUT` → `retrying` (60 s backoff) → worker restarted → attempt 2 dispatched with `resumedFromCheckpointId`, the brief said "Resuming from checkpoint 1", the dispatch carried the patch → finished, auto-approved, **one** settlement. `RUN_PROGRESS×29` from the busy-worker report polls. |
| **D** production change → owner | unit-tested (`tests/office-session-loop.test.ts`), not run live — the fixture has no production file | `vercel.json` in the changed set → hard `REQUIRE_OWNER`, `waiting_on_approval`, no `PAYMENT_AUTHORIZED` until the owner grants |

Also checked on every session: `git status` in the workspace showed only the
intended file(s); nothing outside the workdir was touched; no escrow was
posted and no chain was called (internal tasks); `spentUsd` stayed $0.

The first attempt at scenario A found four defects the unit suite could
not: Claude Code's variadic tool flags eating the positional brief, a
dead run's dispatch row keeping the worker "busy", a missing `retrying →
waiting_on_worker` edge, and a busy worker that did not poll — so no
checkpoint or heartbeat reached the platform until the run ended.
`docs/failure-modes.md` §70 has each one and its fix.

## Waking on events, and the HTTP lane

An `event_driven` session lists the names it wakes on (`lib/session-triggers.ts`
is the vocabulary; `tests/session-triggers.test.ts` pins it). Names are
`source:qualifier…:event`, lower-case, and a session may end one with `:*`
to take everything under a prefix:

| name | fires when |
|---|---|
| `github:acme/api:issues.opened` | the App's webhook delivers `issues` / `opened` for that repo (also `reopened` `closed` `edited` `assigned`, `issues.labeled`, `issues.labeled:<label>`, `issue_comment.created`) |
| `github:acme/api:pull_request.opened` | likewise `reopened` `synchronize` `ready_for_review` `review_requested`, and `pull_request.merged` vs `pull_request.closed` |
| `github:acme/api:ci.failed` / `ci.passed` | a `check_suite` or `workflow_run` **completed** with that conclusion (an in-progress check fires nothing) |
| `github:issues.opened` | the same, on any repo the App sees |
| `http:nightly` | `POST /api/office/sessions/trigger` with `{agent_id, trigger: "nightly"}` and the worker's `x-runtime-secret` |

The webhook (`app/api/github/webhook/route.ts`) fires `fireSessionTriggers`
**after the signature check, before its own handlers, off the response
path**, so a session tick can never make GitHub retry the delivery. It
names no user: the repo-qualified name is the scope, and the App's
installation is the boundary. The HTTP lane is authenticated exactly like
the worker's poll and is scoped to that agent's account; the name is
prefixed `http:` on the way in so a caller can never spell a GitHub-sourced
one. A wake only starts the session's own next wave from its own budget
under its own policy — a trigger is never a payment.

A trigger that arrives while a wave is still running is **queued**: the
loop records `TRIGGER_RECEIVED` first, before any early return (paused,
budget short, wave in progress), and starts the next wave from
`pendingTriggers` once the current one is terminal. The first live run of
the HTTP lane fired six seconds after dispatch and the wake was silently
consumed — the session sat "idle until a trigger" holding the trigger it
had just been sent (`docs/failure-modes.md` §71). The rule now: nothing
that fired is ever lost, and the same name is not queued twice.

## Permission layering

The grant a run actually gets is `narrowGrant(worker grant, session
workspace, task layer)` (`lib/office-session.ts`): the worker's own grant
(what the machine's owner connected it with) is the ceiling, the session's
workspace can only take a permission away or lower a limit, and a `review`
or `verify` task loses `write`/`gitPush`/`install` on top. A layer can never
widen the one below it, and a workdir moves only inward. The worker still
enforces its own `--workdir` regardless of what the platform sends
(`docs/failure-modes.md` §70).

## Pause, for real

`pause` used to mean "dispatch nothing and time out the dead". Now the
dispatch rows of the session's live runs are flagged `paused`, the poll
carries them as `session_pause`, and the worker `SIGSTOP`s the harness
process (`SIGCONT` when the flag clears on resume). The worker keeps
polling, so the heartbeat stays fresh and the loop does not charge the wall
clock while paused — only a worker that actually goes silent still loses
the run (`tests/office-session-loop.test.ts`, "a paused session stops the
clock"). Windows has no `SIGSTOP`; there the worker says so and the run
continues.

## Worker selection on real history

`workerHistoryFrom` (pure, in the loop module) folds every run this
account's sessions ever gave each worker into a success rate, a per-kind
rate and a mean reported cost — from the session states themselves, no
separate ledger. `candidateWorkers` reads the last 200 sessions; a
cancelled run is neither success nor failure; an untried worker stays
`null`, which `selectWorker` treats as unknown, not average.

## A signed proof per internal artifact

When an internal task settles with a content hash, the loop emits
`issue_proof` and the server signs the same EIP-712 work proof a paid market
job gets (`lib/work-proof-store.ts`, `jobRef` `oses:<session>:<task>`), then
records it as a `proof` artifact whose `ref` is `/api/proof/<id>` — so a
third party can verify what this office decided on without trusting the
page. No attester key configured → no proof, and the sha256 receipt on the
artifact stands alone; the task is settled either way.

## From inside the chat

Four MCP tools mirror the control room (`lib/mcp/handlers/office-sessions.ts`,
`docs/mcp-connector.md`): `start_office_session`, `office_session_status`,
`decide_session_approval`, `control_office_session` (pause / resume /
cancel / raise_budget / tick / trigger). Every write goes through the same
owner-scoped server functions the page uses.

## Remote workers (cloud / MCP / webhook)

A session task no longer needs a polling worker. `candidateWorkers` now
offers every configured cloud, MCP and webhook agent on the account as well
(configured, not just declared: a cloud agent without a key or an MCP agent
without a tool is not a candidate). `dispatchRemoteRun` invokes one through
the market's own `runAgentTask` (same skills, same custom instructions,
same `/api/runtime/callback`), records the `agent_tasks` id on the dispatch
row as status `remote`, and marks the run started at once — there is no
pickup to wait for. The brief is `remoteRunBrief`: same fences, no grant
section, no verify command, no deliverable file; the worker's output IS the
deliverable, exactly as on a market job. The callback ticks the session
(`tickSessionForAgentTask`) and `collectRemoteRuns` folds the result through
the same `foldRunReport` a local finish uses; while the task is still
running it emits a heartbeat at most once a minute, so the loop's
dead-worker timeout means "the platform lost the task", not "the callback
has not come yet".

Two rules keep this honest (`tests/office-session-loop.test.ts`): a
`coding` task on a session **with a workspace** never goes remote — the
result has to be a diff in that workspace — and for code a local harness
scores above a remote worker all else equal, because it streams,
checkpoints and resumes and a remote run is one call.

## The other harnesses' grants

`harnessSessionArgv` (`lib/coding-harness.ts`, mirrored in the worker)
compiles the grant onto each CLI's own coarse knob: Codex
`--sandbox workspace-write | read-only` (never `--full-auto`, never
`danger-full-access`; network stays off), Gemini `--approval-mode yolo |
auto_edit | default` (headless, an unapproved tool call simply fails),
OpenCode `--auto` vs `--agent plan`. Cline, dsh and a custom command have
no such knob: the cwd is the whole grant and `HARNESS_SESSION_SUPPORT`
says `cwd-only`. Streaming and native resume remain Claude Code's alone.

### What the second run showed (2026-09-03, after the remote lane, pause and triggers)

Same environment, a fresh scratch cluster (`node scripts/migrate.mjs`),
the build from this commit, one local worker on the real `claude`, and a
30-line stand-in webhook server (`scripts/office-session-e2e.ts` gained
`remote-setup`, `start-remote`, `pause`, `resume`).

- **Remote lane** — a `long_running` session with no workspace and no
  bound worker chose the webhook agent (`dispatched to e2e-hook`), the
  platform POSTed the brief (1,206 chars, fenced, no grant section), the
  stand-in called back, `/api/runtime/callback` answered
  `{"status":"ok","grading":null,"settlement":"queued"}` and woke the
  session, the output became the `deliverable` artifact, the lenient
  policy ALLOWed, the task settled, replay matched. 17 events, ~10 s.
- **Scenario D** — a goal editing `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on the local
  Claude Code worker: 2 files, verification exit 0, and the policy
  answered `REQUIRE_OWNER — production configuration is affected`;
  `SESSION_ESCALATED`, the session waited. The owner's approval settled
  it; `decidedBy=owner`. Nothing moved (internal task).
- **Pause, for real** — 12 s into a run, `pause`: the dispatch row went
  `claimed(paused)`, the worker logged `paused`, `ps` showed the `claude
  --print` process in state `T` (stopped), and the run stayed `running`
  with its heartbeat (no timeout). `resume`: `SIGCONT`, `resumed`, the
  run finished, 3 checkpoints, settled, replay matched.
- **HTTP trigger lane** — a wrong secret → 401; `x:*` → 400 (no
  wildcard); an unlisted name → `woke: 0`; `nightly` → `woke: 1`. And the
  defect this found: the wake landed mid-wave and was dropped (§71). Fixed
  in the same commit; the pure test now pins the queue.

### A real external MCP server as the worker (2026-09-03, third run)

`e2e-mcp` wired to **Microsoft Learn** (`https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp`,
`microsoft_docs_search`, proxy mode) took a session task and settled it: the
platform dispatched through `runAgentTask`, `/api/runtime/execute` did the
call in its own invocation, the callback woke the session, and the
deliverable was 27,736 bytes of Microsoft's own documentation (the
`functionTimeout` section, Consumption plan included), hashed and settled
with replay integrity intact.

Two things that run taught, beyond "it works":

- **The brief carries a query line.** A tool-backed worker's "tool" is a
  search box, and the whole brief is not a query. `remoteRunBrief` now ends
  with `[mcp-query] <phrase>` for `runtimeType: 'mcp'` — the same marker the
  market's briefs use (`lib/mcp-client.ts`), collapsed to one line. An
  agent-shaped MCP server ignores it; a search-shaped one needs it.
- **Proxy mode delivers a result dump.** The deliverable above is the
  server's raw JSON, which is right for an agent-shaped server and wrong for
  a search one — exactly what `docs/office-connectors.md` says about
  `assisted` vs `proxy`. `assisted` (the mode every shipped template uses)
  needs a model key, which this run did not have. A session hiring a search
  server should be in `assisted` mode or expect to read JSON.

Still not driven live: an escrow task (`post_escrow_job` / `settle_escrow`
against a chain).

## Talking to the world outside the session

A session can reach servings outside itself over MCP, in both directions
(`lib/session-tools.ts`, pure; `tests/session-tools.test.ts` pins it). An
owner binds a server on `/office/sessions` or with the `session_tools` MCP
tool; nothing is bound by default and a session with no bindings behaves
exactly as before.

**consult (in).** Before a task is worked — once per task, not per attempt —
the office calls the bound tool with a phrase (`consultQuery`: the task's
title plus the first sentence of its brief, for the same reason a job brief
carries `[mcp-query]`). What comes back is stored as a hashed `report`
artifact, recorded as `TOOL_CONSULTED`, and folded into the next
dispatch's brief through `renderConsult`: attributed to the host that
answered, fenced with the run's nonce, and preceded by the sentence that
says a stranger's server does not get to instruct the worker. A consult
that **failed** is recorded too — that record is what stops the office
asking a dead server once per tick forever.

What a consulted answer is not: evidence. It cannot make a task pass, it is
not a verification layer, and it moves no money — the policy engine never
reads it. It is context, at the bottom of `lib/evidence-assurance.ts`'s
ladder, and the brief says so to the worker.

**notify (out).** When something happens that a person or another system
would want to know, the office calls the bound tool with **one line of
text**, built by `notifyText` and nothing else: what happened, which task
and its risk tier, the amount when money is waiting on a decision, the
loop's own reason, where the session stands, and a link to this page.
Never a deliverable, a diff, a brief, a grader's words, a credential or an
address — pinned by test on both the function and the call site. The
tool's reply is discarded: an outbound notification is not a channel back
into the session, and `TOOL_NOTIFIED` is the only trace it leaves.

| | |
|---|---|
| Events a notify may subscribe to | `APPROVAL_REQUESTED` · `SESSION_ESCALATED` · `SESSION_WAITING` · `TASK_SETTLED` · `TASK_FAILED` · `SESSION_COMPLETED` · `SESSION_FAILED` · `SESSION_EXPIRED` |
| Why only those | each is emitted by the loop (the only place a notify can be raised from), and none is produced by a notification, so a binding cannot make the office talk to itself forever |
| Bounds | 8 bindings per office · https only · 32KB stored per consult, 6KB of it in the brief · 900 characters per notification · 60s per call |
| Credentials | an optional `Authorization` header, encrypted at rest like every other outbound credential, decrypted only for the call and never returned to the page or to MCP |

The notify pass runs in a **wrapper** around the tick rather than inside it
(`notifyCommands`). Written inline it silently never fired for
`SESSION_COMPLETED`: the tick returns early on a dozen paths and the one
that finishes a session returns before the tail — which is exactly the
event an owner binds a pager to. Caught by the test, not in production.

**Both directions ran live (2026-09-03).** A `consult` binding to Microsoft
Learn and a `notify` binding on `APPROVAL_REQUESTED` + `SESSION_COMPLETED`,
on the same scratch cluster and build as the runs above:

- the loop held the dispatch for one tick (`consulting MS Learn docs before
  dispatch`), fetched **25,695 bytes** from `learn.microsoft.com`, recorded
  `TOOL_CONSULTED ok` and a hashed `report` artifact;
- the brief the worker then received was 8,801 characters and carried
  `Context from MS Learn docs (fetched from learn.microsoft.com)`, the
  `<<<BEGIN_EXTERNAL_…>>>` fence and the "not an instruction" sentence —
  confirmed both in the stored dispatch row and in what the worker's own
  server logged;
- two outbound calls fired, `TOOL_NOTIFIED ok` on
  `APPROVAL_REQUESTED` and on `SESSION_COMPLETED` — the second is the tick
  that ends the session, the case the wrapper exists for.

The notify target was a search server standing in for a pager: it is the
https MCP server this container can reach, and what the run proves is the
wire and the payload, not that anybody was paged.

## The two numbers an operator is buying

`/office/sessions` opens with the inbox and then with
`lib/office-metrics.ts` — five figures computed from the session log, not
estimated:

| | what it is |
|---|---|
| **finished without you** | share of finished sessions that needed **no** owner decision. This is the product working |
| **decisions you were asked for** | how many times a person had to decide, and how many the policy settled instead |
| **blocked waiting on a person** | wall-clock the sessions spent stopped, plus the median time an ask was answered in |
| **tasks that held up** | settled / decided, with retries per settled task beside it |
| **what it cost** | the model bill and the money that actually left, kept apart |

What these deliberately do **not** claim: hours saved. Nobody here watches
the owner's clock — a decision made in ten seconds after a night's sleep is
eight hours of *waiting* and ten seconds of *work*, so the field is
`ownerWaitMs` and the label says "blocked waiting", never "saved".
`metricsSentence` says what was done and how often a person was needed and
leaves the arithmetic on an hourly rate to the reader. A metric with no
data renders `—` and says why; an office with no finished session has not
achieved a 0% pass rate.

## Three postures instead of a JSON editor

The policy card now opens with `careful` / `standard` / `hands_off`
(`PRESET_POLICIES` in `lib/approval-policy.ts`) and the current policy read
back as three lists of sentences (`policyInWords`): what settles by itself,
what comes to you, and what is refused whatever the policy says. The JSON
editor is still there, one click behind, and an edited policy shows as
"edited by hand" rather than pretending to be a posture.

The postures differ in exactly two things — how much may settle without a
person, and whether an unreviewed result may settle at all. Everything in
the third list is a hard rule in `evaluateApproval`, which is why it is on
the page: the reassurance an operator needs is the part they cannot switch
off, and `tests/approval-policy.test.ts` runs all three presets against a
workspace escape, a failed test, E4, a touched secret and a production path
to prove none of them can buy its way past.

A preset is a policy, not a mode: `setOfficePolicyPreset` performs the same
write the JSON editor does, and the engine has no idea presets exist.

## What is not built

- **Independent review needs a model key** (`resolveLlm`). Without one the
  reviewer answers "unavailable" and the policy sends the task to the owner
  — never to an automatic pass. A session reviewer's pay is not yet staked
  on its verdict (`lib/review-stake.ts` is wired to the delegation lane
  only).
- **A remote run cannot be paused or cancelled mid-flight.** `pause` and
  `cancel` stop dispatching; a cloud/MCP call already in progress runs to
  its callback, and the result is then folded or discarded by the run's
  state. SIGSTOP is a local worker's privilege.
- **Only English and Korean.** The strip, `/office/sessions` and the
  session page all run through `lib/i18n` now — including the status and
  kind vocabulary (`sess.status.*`, `sess.kindOf.*`, pinned per status by
  `tests/office-session-wiring.test.ts` so a new status cannot ship
  showing its own key). The other eleven locales fall back to English,
  as everything outside the nav and the guide does; filling them needs
  `scripts/translate-dict.mjs` and a key. **`statusReason` stays English**
  in every locale: it is a sentence the loop generates, not a label.
- **The escrow lane ran only under test.** `post_escrow_job` /
  `settle_escrow` are unit-tested and pinned to the one release site;
  they have not moved testnet money in a live session yet. (The remote lane
  itself has now run live against both a stand-in webhook server and a real
  external MCP server.)
