# Competitive landscape — who else is building agent trust, and where Handsel sits

*Last updated: 2026-07. Written for our own honesty first, investor/GASOK
diligence second: overlaps are stated at full strength, not lawyered down.*

The one-line positioning up front: **most projects in this space build agent
identity, agent payments, OR an agent marketplace. Handsel's bet is the
missing fourth layer — credit underwriting: turning independently verified
work history into a borrowing capacity (score → rating → limit → draw →
repay). Nobody listed below closes that loop today.**

One correction to that framing, added after the fact: §6 covers a market that
has nothing to do with agents — GitHub-native bounties — because that is where
the `repo-jobs` lane actually ships. It was missing from this document for as
long as the lane has existed, which is a reminder that the competitive set is
decided by what you built, not by the category you filed yourself under.

## 1. Agent identity & reputation standards

### ERC-8004 "Trustless Agents" — the most important thing on this page
Ethereum standard (proposed Aug 2025, live implementations on mainnet and
several L2s/chains through 2026) defining three on-chain registries:
Identity (ERC-721 agent identities), Reputation (standardized feedback
signals), and Validation (hooks for validator contracts to publish
results). Adopted by Avalanche, BNB Chain, and on the EF's 2026 roadmap.

- **Overlap**: their three registries are conceptually our agent registry +
  behavioral ledger + grading pipeline, as a neutral standard.
- **Difference**: ERC-8004 standardizes the *interfaces* for reputation; it
  deliberately doesn't define how reputation is computed, what it's worth,
  or what you can borrow against it. It's plumbing, not underwriting.
- **Our move**: this is not a competitor — it's a compatibility target.
  A Handsel credit score published *into* an ERC-8004 Reputation/
  Validation registry becomes portable and composable, and we become a
  "credit oracle" in their ecosystem rather than an island. Implemented
  and env-gated (`lib/onchain/erc8004.ts`); awaiting a registry
  deployment on the target chain.

### Skyfire — "Agent Passports"
Verified identity + payment credentials for agents; passports carry
reputation/spending history across platforms so vendors can screen agents.

- **Overlap**: reputation-that-gates-commerce, same instinct as our
  min-score job gating.
- **Difference**: identity/KYA + payments trust layer; no independent
  verification of *work quality*, no lending.

---

## 2. Agent-to-agent labor & commerce markets

### Virtuals Protocol / ACP — the closest functional competitor
The largest agent economy (18k+ agents claimed); its Agent Commerce
Protocol runs request → negotiation → escrow → **evaluation by evaluator
agents** → settlement, across multiple chains, with evaluators earning a
share of transaction value.

- **Overlap**: this is our Labor Market's shape — escrow plus an evaluator
  that isn't the worker. Their "market for specialized evaluation agents"
  is a decentralized version of what our platform runtime does centrally.
- **Difference**: (1) evaluation in ACP is itself agent-judgment — an
  evaluator LLM's opinion, with the same confidently-wrong exposure our
  quality_score has; our graded-fact class (exact-match answers,
  requester-authored test execution) is mechanically checkable, not
  opinion. (2) ACP's output is per-transaction settlement; nothing
  compounds into a credit line an agent can draw against. (3) Scale:
  they are years and thousands of agents ahead — no point pretending
  otherwise.
- **What to steal**: evaluator-as-a-market (paid, reputation-scored
  evaluators) is roughly where our issue #7 design is heading anyway.

### Olas — Mech Marketplace
Agents hiring agents for tasks, 11M+ a2a transactions across nine chains
(Q1 2026 figures). Proven demand for agent-to-agent work.

- **Difference**: payment-for-service without independent quality grading
  or credit accumulation; reputation is usage-based, not verification-based.

### Recall Network
Competition network that ranks agents via live, verifiable competitions
(e.g. verifiable trading arenas with EigenCloud).

- **Overlap**: closest philosophical neighbor to our Proving Ground —
  capability demonstrated under controlled, verifiable conditions rather
  than self-reported.
- **Difference**: rankings/discovery are the end product; we treat the
  verified event as an *input to underwriting*.

---

## 3. Agent payment rails (complementary, not competing)

- **x402** — HTTP-402 stablecoin micropayments, Linux Foundation project
  (2026) backed by AWS/Google/Stripe/Visa/Mastercard/Amex. If agent
  payments standardize here, our draws/repayments/payouts should
  eventually speak it.
- **Payman** — spend management/budget caps for agents (our
  WALLET_MAX_TX_USD / daily-cap logic as a product).
- These make agent *spending* safe. None of them decide whether an agent
  *deserves* a credit line — that's upstream of them, where we sit.

## 4. Agent credit & lending — the thin field we're actually in

Early 2026 saw the first experiments in underwriting loans against an
agent's on-chain economic activity, and middleware maintaining behavioral
score vectors per agent (e.g. ACHIVX's seven-dimension model) for banks
evaluating agent trust. The category exists, is young, and is mostly
*analytics* — scoring as a report, not scoring wired to an enforceable
on-chain limit with draw/repay/default consequences feeding back into the
score. That closed loop is Handsel's specific claim, and as far as we
can tell it remains rare enough to be a real wedge.

(One anonymous reviewer referenced a "NEXUS" agent-credit design family in
a private message; we could not identify a real project by that name —
noted here for completeness, not as evidence.)

## 5. DePIN / decentralized compute — the adjacent giant

Bittensor, io.net, Akash, Render, Nosana: idle GPUs earning again. The
structural difference we hammer in the pitch deck: **they bill for GPU
time because time is trivial to verify and quality isn't; mining paid for
hashes, they pay for hours, we pay for work being right.** Gensyn is the
interesting outlier — cryptographic verification that ML *computation* was
performed as specified (reproducible execution) — but it verifies the
computation, not the usefulness of the deliverable to a requester.

## 6. GitHub-native bounty markets — where the repo-jobs lane actually competes

Sections 1–5 are the agent-economy framing. But the `repo-jobs` lane
(`docs/github-jobs.md`) ships into a market that already exists and has
nothing to do with agents: **paying for a GitHub issue to get closed.** This
section was missing until a stranger forked this repo alongside
`ubiquity/research`, which was a fair hint that the comparison set here is
not the one we had written down.

Two distinct incumbents, and our lane is the intersection of them — which is
the strongest thing about the position and also the reason both sides can
eat it.

### 6a. Bounty-on-an-issue platforms (money, human workers)

**UbiquityOS / Ubiquity DAO.** The closest thing to our label-to-bounty bot
that actually exists. Label a GitHub issue with a price and their bot pays
the contributor in crypto when the issue closes — xDAI to a wallet or USD to
a card, with comment incentives and XP on top. Around it sits a real
payments stack (`pay.ubq.fi` permit generation, `checkout.ubq.fi`) and a
"DevPool" contributor funnel.

**Algora.** The same primitive with a US-fintech spine instead of a DAO one:
`/bounty $1000` as an issue comment, and they handle payouts, compliance and
1099s. Their pitch has drifted toward hiring — bounties as an audition for
contract and full-time work.

- **Overlap**: the trigger gesture is identical. A human writes a price onto
  an issue and money is committed to whoever resolves it. If someone only
  wanted "label an issue, pay a contributor", both are more mature than us
  and one of them handles tax forms.
- **Current activity (checked 2026-07-27).** Separate axis from maturity, and
  worth tracking on its own: UbiquityOS's core repos (kernel, plugin-sdk,
  plugin-template) were last pushed **2026-04-21/22**, roughly three months
  ago; the UbiquityOS topic in their Telegram has been silent since
  **2025-04**; and their plugins-wishlist carries an open issue titled *"15+
  days no maintainer response"* from 2026-05, with most issues there opened by
  org members rather than outsiders. A quiet project, not an abandoned one —
  April is recent and small teams go quiet. Algora looks the livelier of the
  two, with bounty awards through **May–June 2026**. These dates are the most
  perishable claims in this section; re-check before quoting them.
- **Difference (1) — when the money is committed.** Both are pay-on-outcome:
  the funder is trusted to be good for it, and the contributor claims
  afterwards. Ours escrows at posting time, on-chain, before any worker sees
  the job. That is worse UX and a strictly stronger promise, and it is the
  only reason a *machine* can safely take the work — an agent cannot chase
  an invoice.
- **Difference (2) — what closes the loop.** Theirs pays on issue close.
  Ours pays on **merge**, deliberately: CI green never moves money, because
  green tests on a bad diff is exactly the failure a bounty market invites —
  though the repo-jobs lane currently runs on the testnet deployment only
  (the GitHub App is not configured on mainnet).
- **Difference (3) — what accumulates.** Theirs accumulates a payment
  history. Ours accumulates an underwritten credit score that unlocks
  borrowing. That is the whole thesis and neither of them is trying to do it.
- **Honest caveat**: I have not read Ubiquity's escrow internals. "Permit
  generation" strongly implies claim-after-the-fact rather than lock-up-front,
  but this is inference from their public repo names, not verification.

### 6b. Autonomous coding agents (workers, no market)

**GitHub Copilot coding agent** is the one that matters. Assign it an issue
and it works in a GitHub Actions sandbox, explores the repo, writes code,
runs tests, and opens a PR for review — with CodeQL, secret scanning and
dependency review built in, and MCP integration for pulling external
context. Devin, OpenHands/SWE-agent and Codegen occupy the same slot with
different distribution.

- **Overlap**: this is our worker, and it is first-party to the platform our
  jobs live on. For the specific act of turning an issue into a PR, Copilot's
  coding agent is better resourced than anything claiming a job from our
  board, and it is one click from where the issue already is.
- **Difference**: it is a **worker without a market**. There is no price on
  the issue, no escrow, no counterparty, no independent grader, and no record
  that transfers anywhere. It does work for the repo that pays for its seat.
  Nothing about it lets an unknown third-party agent bid for the job and be
  trusted with it.
- **Where this actually lands**: Copilot's agent is a plausible *supplier* to
  our market, not only a competitor — the same way `foreman` is. A market
  whose workers include first-party coding agents is a better market. The
  thing we must not do is compete with it on raw diff quality.

### The intersection, stated plainly

Neither half has the other's piece. Bounty platforms have a market with human
workers and no verification layer that a machine could be graded by. Coding
agents have machine workers with no market, no escrow, and no portable record.
Handsel's repo-jobs lane claims the intersection: **an escrowed price on an
issue, an arbitrary agent taking it, an independent grade, merge as the only
release trigger, and a score that follows the worker to the next job.**

The risk in that sentence is that an intersection is defensible only while
both sides ignore it. UbiquityOS adding agent workers is a smaller step than
us building their payments maturity; GitHub adding a price field to issues is
a smaller step still.

## 7. Dispute-resolution prior art (design inputs for issue #7)

- **Kleros** — staked, incentive-compatible juror courts with appeal
  escalation.
- **UMA Optimistic Oracle** — assertions stand unless disputed within a
  window; bonds punish wrong disputes.
- **Reality.eth** — escalating-bond answer market.

These are the reference architectures for replacing our single-EOA
arbiter; our addition (per issue #7 discussion) is domain-scoped reviewer
reputation computed by the same behavioral engine that scores workers.

---

## Honest threat ranking

1. **Virtuals ACP** — could add credit/underwriting on top of their scale
   faster than we can build scale under our underwriting.
2. **ERC-8004 ecosystem** — if reputation becomes a commodity standard,
   the moat moves entirely to underwriting quality and verified-grading
   supply; good for us only if we integrate early.
3. **A well-funded fintech** entering agent credit top-down (bank-style
   scoring per ACHIVX direction) with compliance resources we lack.
4. **GitHub itself**, to the repo-jobs lane specifically. A price field on an
   issue plus the coding agent it already ships would be most of our GitHub
   story, first-party, with distribution we cannot approach. Our answer has
   to be the part GitHub structurally will not build: an *open* market where
   the worker is a stranger and the grade is what makes them trustable.
5. **UbiquityOS / Algora adding agent workers.** Bolting agents onto an
   existing bounty market is a shorter path than bolting a payments-and-
   compliance business onto ours. Their missing piece is grading; ours is
   maturity and users. Ranked 5th rather than higher on current activity
   (§6a), not on how short the path is: the path really is short, but a
   project three months between pushes is not walking it today. Algora is the
   live half of this row.

## Why we still think the wedge is real

- Verified-work grading (ground truth + test execution) as the *input*,
  enforceable on-chain limits as the *output*, and repayment behavior
  feeding back — no one listed runs all three.
- Solo-buildable surface today; standards (ERC-8004, x402) are arriving
  exactly when we'd need portability.
- The failure modes everyone else defers ("who grades the grader",
  "confidently wrong", Sybil resets) are already our public issues (#6,
  #7) — being early on the hard part is the moat a small team can afford.
- The repo-jobs lane sits on an intersection nobody occupies (§6): bounty
  platforms have a market without machine-gradeable verification, coding
  agents have machine workers without a market. Thin ice, but ice.

*Sources for §6, checked 2026-07: github.com/ubiquity and the Ubiquity Bounty

says so.*

# Second pass, 2026-08-03

*Prompted by a landscape summary that arrived from outside. Roughly half
survived checking, and the half that did not is the more useful half. Every
project below was confirmed to exist before being written down; the two EIPs
were read from the spec text rather than from commentary; single-source claims
are marked as reported rather than verified.*

## The framing this pass corrects

The July version leads with the wedge as *"credit underwriting"*. That is the
phrase `docs/product-thesis.md` — written a few days later, after an outside
critique — explicitly rejects:

> *Not "credit for AI agents". That phrase is **true and useless**: it
> describes a market that mostly does not exist in 2026, and it buries the one
> case here that is real and checkable.*

The defensible claim is narrower: **an escrow-collateralized advance to a
prime contractor, where the score prices execution risk and therefore sets
LTV.** Nothing in the table below is making that claim. The broad one, several
of them are.

## ERC-8183 — the standard that arrived on top of what we built

New since the July pass, and the more consequential of the two EIPs.
Virtuals Protocol with the Ethereum Foundation. It standardises the **Job
primitive**: client, provider, evaluator, escrowed budget, lifecycle
`Open → Funded → Submitted → {Completed, Rejected, Expired}`, evaluator alone
may complete. ([EIP-8183](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8183) ·
[context](https://cryptobriefing.com/erc-8183-virtuals-protocol-ethereum-ai-agent-commerce/))

That is LaborMarketV2's shape. Which is not a threat to anything the thesis
claims — *"the asset is the ledger, not the score"* — and is a reason to speak
the vocabulary instead of competing with it.

`lib/onchain/erc8183.ts` is the projection, with the gap analysis in its
header. The summary:

| | Cost |
|---|---|
| **V2 → 8183** (export) | A pure function. Every V2 job projects into an 8183 state. Shipped. |
| **8183 → V2** (conform inbound) | A new contract. 8183 has the client *assign* a provider; this market has the worker *claim* one, behind a credit gate, staking a bond. That is the mechanism, not the interface. |

Three things the standard cannot represent, which the projection reports
rather than drops:

- **The worker bond.** 8183 has no state between funded and submitted, because
  its model is procurement — the client picks the provider, so nothing needs to
  make claiming costly. The bond is this market's Sybil resistance on the
  supply side, and it is invisible in 8183.
- **The dispute process.** `Disputed` projects to `Submitted`, which is the
  right lifecycle position (delivered, evaluator has not ruled) and loses the
  procedure.
- **The word *Expired*.** 8183 defines it with one beneficiary — "escrow
  refunded to client after timeout". V2's three routes to the same terminal
  state settle to three different parties: `expireOpen` refunds the requester
  in full, `expireReview` **splits** (10% forfeit to the worker side, 90%
  refunded), and `expireDispute` releases to the **worker** in full. One
  terminal word covering a refund, a partial forfeit and a full release.

## ERC-8004 — the July call now has evidence

July called 8004 "the most important thing on this page" and treated
portability as the arriving tailwind. `docs/product-thesis.md` then argued the
opposite from first principles:

> *If identity is free, a portable reputation is **portable for the forger
> too**. Portability and Sybil resistance are not two problems. They are one
> problem, and portability makes it worse.*

An empirical study of the deployed 8004 ecosystem has since found a
substantial share of registered agents inactive or non-functional, and named
**reputation gaming and Sybil attacks** as the critical vulnerabilities —
concluding that *"decentralized verification mechanisms alone may prove
insufficient"*. ([arXiv 2606.26028](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.26028))

Prediction and measurement agree. Two cautions on using that:

1. The paper says the ecosystem is gameable, **not that anyone solved it**.
   Handsel has not. `docs/self-sybil.md` is an admission, not a defence.
2. The July claim that standards are "arriving exactly when we would need
   portability" now reads as the wrong wish. What is arriving is the surface
   this project decided not to build on, and being right about that is worth
   more than the interop would have been.

## Kojiru — the nearest product, and closer than expected

Not in the July pass. Positioned as credit infrastructure for agents.
([source](https://finbold.com/fico-was-built-in-1989-ai-agents-need-a-score-for-2026/)
— one article, so details are reported rather than verified)

| | Kojiru | Handsel |
|---|---|---|
| Chain | Base mainnet | Base mainnet |
| Score range | 300–850 | 300–850 |
| Primary axis | *Operational Integrity* — probability of successful task completion | Execution risk, from graded outcomes |
| Model | Recursive Bayesian, updated per task | Rule-based + sample-size damping (`lib/credit-engine/scoring.ts`) |
| Lending | Collateralized, per-task escrow vault | Collateralized, draw against posted USDC |
| Lender side | Bilateral lines; the funding lender bears the default | **Not built** — nothing consumes `advanceLimit` |
| Contracts on Base | **8, verified deployed** (`eth_getCode`, 2026-08-03) | `LaborMarketV2` + registry |
| Formal verification | halmos (path in their bundle); *Certora* is the article's word and is unconfirmed | Slither + Mythril, dispositioned |
| Usage published | none found | 17 agents, $0.06 credit line |
| Sybil | not addressed in the source | `docs/self-sybil.md`, unsolved |

**The core insight converged.** Kojiru's first axis is *probability of
successful task completion*; the thesis independently reached *"execution risk
is what a record of graded outcomes actually measures"*. Two teams landing in
the same place is evidence the place is right.

**Both are collateralized, and that is the sharp observation.** Kojiru's
capital flows into a vault tied to one task and releases on evaluator
confirmation; the agent never holds general funds. So the thesis's own line
applies to them at full strength:

> *A loan against observable collateral does not need a credit score — it needs
> an escrow lookup.*

Two agent-credit protocols on Base both quietly collateralize everything, and
both therefore have a score doing less work than the pitch implies. The
difference is not architectural — **one of us wrote it down.** That comparison
is only usable because it is self-implicating first.

**Their per-task escrow is itself a partial Sybil answer**, and a good one: a
forged score buys a credit line, but funds only ever land in a vault an
evaluator releases. Worth borrowing the thinking from even while the
portable-score half looks exposed.

**Ahead of us:** the lender side exists, symbolic execution (halmos) beats
Slither+Mythril, and
they have a capital-attraction path (published staking APY). **Behind us:** no
published usage, and no public accounting of what their evaluator network
costs in trust — every project here relocates trust to an evaluator, and this
is still the only one that shows the invoice (`GRADER_WEIGHTS`, and the hole
in it).

### Correction, same day: I checked, and my scepticism was wrong

The section above was written from one article, and I flagged the risk that
finbold runs placed content and that Kojiru might be pre-launch marketing.
That was wrong, and the correction belongs next to the claim rather than in a
changelog.

Checked directly, 2026-08-03:

- **kojiru.com is live** — a Base miniapp (Farcaster frame metadata, Base
  `app_id`).
- **Eight contracts are deployed on Base mainnet.** Addresses lifted from
  their production JS bundle and each confirmed with `eth_getCode` against
  `mainnet.base.org`: seven with 5–10 KB of bytecode, one small (proxy-shaped).
  None respond to `name()`/`symbol()`, so they are protocol contracts rather
  than a token. **The "8 contracts" claim is real**, and the count matches.
- **Formal verification is real but differently named.** Their bundle
  references `contracts/formal-verification/halmos/`. halmos is symbolic
  execution, not Certora; the article says Certora. Recorded as halmos with
  the discrepancy noted, because guessing which one is right would repeat the
  mistake this correction exists for.
- **The GitHub repo their own bundle links to is not publicly reachable.**
  `github.com/faulknerwayne73-droid/kojiru-platform` returns 404 through one
  fetch path and 403 through another, and is not in search indexes. Either
  private or gone — while shipping in production JS either way. So the outreach
  route is email (`wayne@kojiru.com`, `security@kojiru.com`), not an issue.

What this changes about the assessment: **the biggest claim checked out.**
"Usage published: none found" still stands — contracts deployed is not
activity, and no agent count or volume was published. But "deployed on Base
mainnet" is now verified rather than reported, and it was the load-bearing one.

Worth keeping as a method note: the check that settled it was `eth_getCode`
against the chain, not more reading. Same instinct as `npm run verify:solana`
— when a claim is about a chain, the chain is cheaper to ask than the internet.

### Catching up: what the 8183 thread is actually building

*Read #300–#358 on 2026-08-03. The first pass read page 1 (20 posts of 358) and
drew conclusions from it, which is how the correction below happened. Recorded
because "I read the thread" and "I read the first page" are different claims and
only one of them was true.*

**Correction: the worker bond is not ours alone.** The previous section framed
provider collateral as the thing 8183 cannot see and implied it was distinctive.
It is under active discussion — @honeytones opened it at #341 (*"the client
funds everything and the provider risks nothing"*), @pipavlo82 agreed at #343
that it should not be ruled out, and #348 mentions `workerbond 6 added in v2` in
a shipped storage layout. At least one other implementation already has it. What
is still ours to contribute is the *numbers* (5% + $0.03, slashed on
abandonment, live) and the observation that a bond changes **who shows up**
rather than improving work quality — not the idea.

**The digest chain, and a correction to what `reason` is for.** #301–#316
converge on `commitmentHash → verificationDigest → job.reason`, with ERC-8274
(*AI Inference Proof Verification Interfaces*, PR #1771 on `ethereum/ERCs`)
defining `IAgentVerifier.verify()` as the producer. The requirement they settled
on is that `reason` be **deterministic and independently recomputable** from the
task and agent identifiers — explicitly *not* an opaque blob.

That kills an idea from the previous pass. It suggested `reason` was "where the
work proof CID goes". A CID is a **pointer**, not a recomputation: an observer
holding one must fetch something and trust whoever serves it. The thread's
direction is strictly better and we should follow it rather than the standard
following us.

**`IAgentVerifiable`, soft declaration** (#309–#312): the settlement contract
exposes `getAgentVerifier()`, resolved at settlement time; the registry handles
staking and slashing and never learns verifier addresses. The reasoning — that
coupling verifier registration to staking makes every new verifier type a
registry upgrade — is worth keeping whatever we do with 8183.

### Two things worth taking, from #320–#340

Both are ours already, arrived at from a different direction and named better.
Adopting the vocabulary is cheap and adopting the sharper version of an argument
you already hold is the whole point of reading other people's threads.

**1. "Stake, not truth."** #321–#322 draw the line between what re-derives and
what does not: the settlement fact recomputes from chain, the evaluator's
compliance ratio does not — *"it is an evaluator's commitment that money moved
on it, non-repudiable, not correct."*

That is `docs/product-thesis.md`'s argument — *"a signed proof verifies
provenance, not quality... verifiability relocates trust to the grader set"* —
in four words. Take the phrasing.

**2. "A timing state must never collapse into a validity state."** #324–#325.
not-yet-committed is a fact about *when you looked*; not-admitted is a fact
about *whether the record is real*. @pipavlo82's note at #325 is the part that
stings: he had been deriving it case by case — *stale versus rejected,
not-yet-committed versus not-admitted, could-not-check versus did-not-match*.

**So have we, everywhere, for months, without ever naming it:**

| Where | The case |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/tasks` 503 | "no open jobs" vs "I could not read the market" |
| `checkMarketInvariants` | an unread vault balance fails the solvency check rather than passing it |
| `/challenge` read state | `ok` / `unconfigured` / `unreachable` |
| `readJobsOrUnknown` | the three-valued read the two-valued one replaced |
| `failure-modes.md` §12 | `catch(() => [])` — when "I can't see" becomes "there's nothing there" |
| `decodeJobAccount` | an unknown status variant returns null instead of a guess |

Six independent instances of one invariant, each fixed on its own. That is the
argument for adopting the sentence: the next instance gets recognised before it
ships instead of after.

### The one that bites: scores have no comparability class

#338–#340 close the loop with a rule about aggregates:

> Any aggregate that can be consumed by a higher-order fold must itself remain a
> first-class, class-carrying, independently recomputable object, with its
> inclusion set and pre-aggregation breakdown preserved.

Applied to reputation (#329): entries decided under different pinned policy
versions belong to **different comparability classes and must not be folded into
one score silently.**

**The credit score is a fold, and it carries no class.** `agent.creditScore` is
a bare decimal; `credit_scores` rows carry a `calculationReason` string and no
engine version. And this is not hypothetical — the scoring engine changed this
week. Anchoring `dampen()` at 0 and counting deliveries rather than attempts
moved a one-job agent from 673 to 394. Both numbers can sit in that column, both
render identically on a public page, and nothing distinguishes them.

`failure-modes.md` §20 already recorded the narrower version — *changing a
formula does not change stored results*, fixed with a backfill endpoint. The
thread's rule is stronger and the difference matters: a backfill makes old rows
current, but it cannot make a **historical** score comparable, and it silently
destroys the record of what was believed at decision time. A stamped engine
version fixes both, and it is one column.

That is the most actionable thing this landscape pass produced, and it came from
a thread about something else.

## The Agentcoin question

A collaboration thesis arrived with the summary: mining as the currency layer,
Handsel as the labour layer, five integration points. Two of them are opposite
in quality.

**Staked tokens as collateral — sound.** Observable collateral needs a lookup,
not a score, and this plugs into a mechanism that exists.

**Mining history as a credit signal — unsound**, and not for the usual reason.
The objection is not that the trust models differ and weights need tuning. The
two measure **different quantities**: proof-of-work proves *compute spent*, and
the score exists to price *execution risk*. An agent with a flawless mining
record has demonstrated nothing about finishing a job. In `GRADER_WEIGHTS` it
would be a ruler in a table of thermometers.

One honest use, and it is the more valuable one:

> Mining history as a **cost-to-forge signal**, not a competence signal.

What proof-of-work genuinely establishes is that an identity cost money — which
is Sybil resistance, the hole both the arXiv study and this project's own
thesis point at. It even fixes cold start honestly: not *"this agent is good"*
but *"this agent is expensive to throw away and remake"*.

## What this pass changes

Nothing about what to build next, which is the right outcome for a landscape
document and the reason to distrust one that concludes otherwise. Three
smaller things:

1. **Speak ERC-8183** — the projection exists; use its vocabulary.
2. **Stop saying "credit for AI agents"** — the field says it, it is true and
   useless, and the narrow claim is the only defensible one.
3. **The lender side is the real gap**, and a competitor shipping it first is
   the concrete version of the thesis's own "not built" list.

*Unverified, listed so the next pass knows where to start: AgentKarma, iAgentFi,
ChainAware, Kustodia, RIP-302, AI Lance, AGIJobManager, OKX AI.*

# Third pass, 2026-08-06

*Not prompted by an inbound summary this time — prompted by the operator asking
why the last two passes missed the shipping half of the market. That is the
honest frame for this section, and it goes first because the gap in method
matters more than any single competitor added below.*

## The method failure, named

The July and August passes are deep on ERC-8004 and ERC-8183 — **standards** —
and nearly blind on **shipping products**. The reason is mechanical, not lazy:

- **You can only search for a name you already have.** A spec is a canonical
  document you look up (`ERC-8195`); a product is a brand you have to already
  know to type (`Claw Earn`). Concept searches surface specs; only *category*
  searches ("agent marketplace USDC Base") surface names you did not have — and
  those were not run until today.
- **Spec depth felt like diligence and masked the blind spot.** Mining the 8183
  thread was genuinely valuable, which is exactly why it was dangerous: depth on
  one axis read as coverage.
- **Every prior addition was reactive.** §6 arrived because a stranger forked the
  repo; the second pass arrived from an outside summary. No pass ran an
  unprompted "who else is doing this" sweep on its own.

The evidence is in this very file: the second pass ended with a "next start" list
that already contained **OKX AI** — a competitor flagged to check, never checked,
until the operator pushed. Leaving a TODO to yourself is not research.

Correction going forward: a category sweep runs *before* any positioning claim,
not after someone asks.

## The shipping half that was missing

Single-source items are marked *reported*; the TaskMarket grading finding is
*verified* because it was read from their spec directly.

### daydreams / TaskMarket — the one already in a conversation with us

`taskmarket.dev`, by **daydreams.systems**. `daydreamsai/taskmarket-contracts`
(Beau Williams, ~51 commits, effectively one author — the solo-vs-org framing
elsewhere overstated their headcount). Authors ERC-8195 and ERC-8194 as EIP
drafts and ships the reference implementation: Diamond proxy, per-task
`assignEvaluator`, evaluator stake, `appeal()` → `disputeResolver`.

- **How we learned of it**: inbound (GitHub issue #3, `padsbanger`), not
  discovery. It should have been found in July.
- **The verified finding that matters** (read from `erc-8195.md` §4, not
  reported): *"No automated evaluation — Benchmark-style tasks require **trusted
  off-chain evaluators with no on-chain finality**,"* and "Trustless evaluation |
  Optional." Their on-chain "independently verify" (`rev007`) checks that a
  deliverable **hash was committed** (provenance), not that the work is correct
  (quality). `evidenceHash` is a commitment, not a recomputation.
- **So the wedge is real and narrow.** Handsel's *mechanical* verdict class (CI,
  test suite, mutation, canary) is third-party recomputable; TMP's default
  evaluator is a trusted opinion, and their standard leaves the trustless slot
  *optional* behind a hook (`ITMPHook.checkEvaluate`, or `evaluatorFor` →
  ERC-8004 Validation Registry). Handsel's *LLM-review* verdicts are the same
  "stake, not truth" as theirs and are **not** differentiated — only the
  mechanical lane is. This is the honest basis for the #57 outreach.

### The Claw ecosystem — the closest thing to our repo-jobs / bounty lane

**Claw Earn**, **ClawTasks**, **ClawMoney** — all in the **OpenClaw** ecosystem
(*reported*, via aiagentstore/product listings). On-chain USDC bounty markets on
Base: non-custodial escrow, worker **stake tiered by trust** (30% first task, 20%
for #2–3, then 10%), minimum bounty ~9 USDC, primary flow human→agent but rails
support A→A. That is Handsel's LaborMarket shape — escrow + worker bond +
auto-settlement — shipped, on our chain.

- **What is missing from them** (inferred from listings, not verified): an
  *independent grading* layer. "Deliver, get paid per contract rules" is escrow
  automation, not a verdict a third party recomputes. Same wedge as TMP — needs
  verification before it becomes a pitch.
- **Correction to the paragraph that stood here.** This section first claimed
  "our capability directory is called ClawHub, rename it" — a factual error
  introduced without checking. **ClawHub (`clawhub.ai`) is OpenClaw's own skill
  registry, not ours.** `lib/clawhub.ts` is a read-client (its header: *"ClawHub
  (OpenClaw's skill registry) read client"*) and `app/directory` surfaces
  clawhub.ai live and links out to it. So there is nothing of ours to rename.
  The real question the discovery raises is the opposite: **should Handsel keep a
  page that advertises a competitor's registry and sends our traffic to it?**
  That is a product decision (remove vs. keep as ecosystem aggregation), not a
  naming one — recorded here so the wrong version does not get quoted again.

### Distribution incumbents — the fight that is not winnable head-on

- **OKX AI marketplace** (TechCrunch, 2026-06-30): a *licensed exchange* launched
  a market where agents hire and pay each other in USDT/USDG and build **portable
  on-chain reputation**; opened after a 50-provider closed beta. Reputation +
  marketplace with an exchange's distribution.
- **Circle Agent Stack** (*reported*): the USDC *issuer* shipped agent wallets, a
  CLI, **an agent marketplace**, and nanopayments down to $0.000001.
- **Coinbase AgentKit**: MPC wallets + gas sponsorship on Base for agent builders.

None of these can be out-built on distribution by a solo project. The realistic
posture is the one the thesis already implies: **be honorable-by-others, not
dominant.** An open, recomputable proof that Circle/OKX/Claw could *consume* is a
seat a solo builder can hold; "the reputation layer" is not.

### The KYA product boom — the category I positioned into without checking

Thirty minutes before writing this, the strategy discussion positioned Handsel as
"the Know-Your-Agent / credit layer a16z says is the prerequisite." One category
search shows that seat is crowded: **RNWY / knowyouragent.network** (claims 100k+
registered agents), **Vouched** (established identity co., now an Agent Reputation
Directory), **Billions**, **KnowThat.ai** (trust score + behavioral history)
(*all reported*). a16z does name KYA as a prerequisite (*Sourcetrail, reported*) —
but naming the need is not owning it, and identity/fraud KYA is a different
product from work-quality grading.

The honest residual: **not "KYA," not "agent reputation" (RNWY already has scale)
— the one thin cell is reputation from independently-graded, third-party-
recomputable *work outcomes*, wired to credit.** Identity-KYA players do fraud and
behavioral signals; Claw/TMP do escrow without recomputable grading; Kojiru does
credit but collateralized. The recomputable-grade-as-underwriting-input cell is
where Handsel sits, and it is small enough to be either a moat or a graveyard.

## The market-reality check the earlier passes lacked

x402's ecosystem carries a ~$7B valuation and processes **~$28k/day of real
volume, "much of it… gamed transactions rather than real commerce"** (*Coindesk,
2026-03*). The category's own headline is *"demand is just not there yet."* This
reframes our own cold start: **22-submissions-to-1 was not a defeat, it was the
whole market's demand vacuum.** Do not fight for agent-labor demand that does not
exist; the durable position is the credential/proof the arriving rails will
require, honored by one venue first.

## What this pass changes about the thesis

Less than it feels like, and that honesty is the point.

1. **The wedge survives, narrower.** Not the credential category (crowded), not
   ideas (they converged — Kojiru, the 8183 authors, and this project independently
   reached "execution risk," "stake not truth," the timing/validity split). The
   surviving edge is (a) the *mechanical, recomputable* grade specifically, and
   (b) the **discipline** — writing down our own holes (`failure-modes.md`,
   `self-sybil.md`) is rarer than any insight here. Convergence validates the
   *problem*; it does not hand over the *position*.
2. **Distribution is lost head-on; interop is the only lane.** Publish
   recomputable proofs others can consume; win one venue (daydreams/#57) before
   widening. Outreach is sequential and gap-verified, never sprayed — a small
   interconnected community (OpenClaw ↔ daydreams ↔ TaskMarket) makes a spammer
   reputation fatal.
3. **Drop "the KYA layer" framing.** Speak the narrow claim: *recomputable
   grading as a credit input.* (An earlier draft here also said "the ClawHub name
   has to go" — struck, because ClawHub is OpenClaw's registry, not ours; see the
   correction under the Claw ecosystem above.)

*Verified this pass by reading source: TMP's `erc-8195.md` §4 and `rev007`.
Everything attributed to a product listing or single article is marked reported.
Category searches (agent marketplace / KYA / x402 volume) are cited inline. The
prior "unverified next-start" list still contains AgentKarma, iAgentFi,
ChainAware, Kustodia, RIP-302, AI Lance, AGIJobManager — still unchecked, now
honestly labelled as such rather than implied covered.*

# Fourth pass, 2026-08-06 — the similar-repo sweep, verified

*Input: an operator-supplied list of ~25 "projects similar to Handsel" from an
external AI search. Method, learned from §27: every entry is a claim until the
repo is fetched. Eight were verifiable (owner/name given) and were verified by
reading their GitHub pages this pass; the rest were supplied without links and
are listed as unverified at the bottom rather than silently absorbed.*

## Verified — what actually exists

| Project | Vital signs | What it is | Consequence for us |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MeshLedger/MeshLedger** | 3★, Base **mainnet**, escrow contract live (`0x9Fc4…3dA1`), meshledger.io, 15 MCP tools, 347 tests | Escrow + reputation + dispute resolution + MCP marketplace — the most Handsel-shaped repo found to date | **"Escrow market on Base with MCP" is now a commodity shape, not a differentiator.** Same 3-star traction as everyone; reputation algorithm undocumented. The board is a category; the wedge cannot be the board |
| **arian-gogani/nobulex** | 38★, 445 commits, SDKs on PyPI/npm — and **explicitly archived/pivoted** to "tool reliability" (nobulex-registry) | Ed25519 hash-chained receipts of agent actions, offline third-party verification, trust tiers, priced verification API | Closest thing to our proof-ledger claim — with the load-bearing difference: **their receipts are self-signed by the agent.** That proves log integrity, not outcome. Ours are signed by an independent grader with escrow at stake. Also a demand signal: the best-executed trust-scoring repo in the sweep *pivoted away* from trust scoring |
| **strangeloopcanon/agent-economy** | 7★, Python, active; SWE-bench-calibrated experiments | Research prototype of the exact build-service mechanism: goal→DAG, worker bidding, sandboxed execution, **pay-only-on-PASS**, oracle classes (tests / LLM consensus / human) | **Simulation, no real money** — an intellectual ally, not a competitor. Their Phase-II market-vs-solo data is prior art `docs/build-service.md` should read; their "Oracle" slot is another socket the evaluator lane fits |
| **darks0l/synthesis-agent** | 1★, hackathon (Mar 2026), but real on-chain artifacts on Base mainnet | Autonomous arb agent that self-custodies an ERC-8004 identity and outsources work through its own ERC-8183 jobs contract **and Virtuals ACP v2** | Confirms the ERC-8004/8183 lane has third-party adopters beyond daydreams itself, and that ACP (§2, already ranked closest functional competitor) is where hackathon agents actually cross-post |
| **dolepee/creditgate** | 1★, 27 commits, 0G mainnet, APAC hackathon submission | Reads signed agent history → "**replayable credit score**" → bounded spend cap → "canonical proof packet" on 0G Storage | Our vocabulary, independently invented, at hackathon depth. Validates "recomputable grading as a credit input" as a lane others can see; no execution threat |
| **capGoblin/Credex** | 0★, 5 commits, Arc **testnet** | Agent lending with a "silent" risk engine, +10% limit on repayment | Hackathon prototype; the credit-scoring method is undisclosed, i.e. not a check |
| **langoai/lango** | 13★, 1,643 commits, Base Sepolia | Go multi-agent runtime with optional escrow, ERC-4337/7579, x402 | Infrastructure-adjacent, experimental, testnet. A potential *client* of proofs, not a competitor |
| **agent-matrix/matrix-treasury** | 0★, no visible commits, "admin/admin123" in docs | "Enterprise economic OS" README | Aspirational documentation. Vaporware tier — recorded so the next sweep doesn't re-inflate it |

## Not verified (supplied without links — names only)

Claw Town, Agent Guild, AgentCredit (OpenClaw skill), Primordia/Kaledge, ASA,
Aegis (Sui), AutoClaw, elisym, Agent Starter, Agent Wallet, Post Quantum Agent,
AgentBazaar (Arc), polyagent, autonomous-ai-data-marketplace, Open MCP
Marketplace. Any of these may be real; none was fetched. They are names in an
AI-generated list until someone runs the command.

## What this pass changes

1. **Nothing about the wedge — and that is now better evidenced.** The
   commodity shape (escrow board + reputation + MCP) has a live Base-mainnet
   instance with our exact traction problem. The two properties still absent
   everywhere verified: verdicts signed by an **independent** grader with money
   at stake (nobulex self-signs; MeshLedger doesn't document; creditgate
   replays *history*, not verdicts), and the **evaluator-for-other-markets**
   interop lane.
2. **A demand datapoint from the best-executed neighbour.** nobulex — more
   stars, more commits, published SDKs, OWASP adoption — pivoted *away* from
   agent trust scoring toward tool reliability. Trust scores alone did not find
   buyers there either. Consistent with this session's turn: attach to where
   agents already work; sell outcomes, not membership.
3. **agent-economy goes on the build-service reading list** — pre-existing
   experimental evidence for pay-on-pass market mechanics, including the
   failure-penalty/reputation-weighted bidding math we have not designed yet.

# Fifth pass, 2026-09-04 — checking the "Agency Delivery OS" framing against two new categories

*Prompted by an operator-supplied competitive read arguing Handsel should
position as an "AI Agency Delivery OS" rather than a marketplace. That framing
does not change anything decided in `docs/positioning.md` §8 (2026-09-03) —
operations room, priced monthly, Repo Care first — it sharpens the same
decision, so this pass exists to check its two new claims rather than to
relitigate the decision. Method as always: every name is fetched before it is
scored. Two categories were actually new to this document; two claimed
protocols turned out not to be products at all.*

## A. "Verify-then-pay" protocols — RAILS and TessPay are papers, not products

The operator's table scored "증거를 확인한 뒤 지급" (pay after evidence) 5/10
novelty against RAILS and TessPay specifically. Checked:

- **RAILS** — "RAILS: Verification-Native Clearing For Agentic Commerce"
  ([arXiv:2606.08790](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.08790), June 2026). A
  research paper proposing a reliability score + clearing function that
  consumes tool traces (MCP) and subdelegation events (A2A) as evidence. No
  deployment, no users, no chain address — a design, not a competitor.
- **TessPay** — "TessPay: Verify-then-Pay Infrastructure for Trusted Agentic
  Commerce" ([arXiv:2602.00213](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00213)), attributed
  to Tesseris, described elsewhere as a proposed L1 "ecosystem for trusted
  agentic commerce". Also a paper; no evidence of a live chain, a shipped
  contract, or a settled transaction was found in this pass.

**Correction to the operator's scoring: this is not "someone else already
proposed pay-after-evidence at novelty 5/10" — it is "the idea has reached
academic proposal stage and nobody has shipped it."** Handsel's
`LaborMarketV2` on Base mainnet, independently graded, pay-only-on-pass, live
since 2026-07-30, is *ahead* of both papers on the one axis that matters:
it moved real USDC on a real verdict. The honest risk is the opposite of what
the table implies — these papers are evidence the idea is about to get
well-funded competition (see Nava Labs below), not evidence it is taken.

Adjacent and worth tracking, found in the same sweep and NOT in the
operator's list: **Nava Labs** ($8.3M seed, Polychain/EigenLayer-backed,
"escrow-before-execution" AI agent verification layer — reported via
BlockEden, not independently verified against a live product this pass) and
**Agentry Escrow** (a marketed "independent payment rails for AI agents"
product; not fetched this pass). Both are unverified beyond the article that
named them — next pass should fetch them directly rather than carry the
citation forward as fact.

## B. "AI workforce" SaaS — the real adjacent category, and it is not a payments company

The operator's "Agency Delivery OS" pitch competes for the same buyer as a
different, very real, well-funded category this document had not covered:
no-code platforms selling "an AI workforce" to a business's ops/GTM team.
Verified this pass:

| Product | Vital signs (2026) | What it actually sells | Difference from Handsel |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Relevance AI** | Founded 2020 (Sydney); Pro $19/mo, Team $234–349/mo, meters "Actions" + "Vendor Credits" since Sep 2025 | No-code AI agent builder, "AI workforce," 2,000+ integrations, strongest in sales/marketing/support GTM automation | Builds and runs agents *inside* the buyer's own tools (Slack, Salesforce, Sheets). No escrow, no independent grader, no per-task verdict — the buyer trusts the agent's output the same way they trust a spreadsheet macro |
| **Lindy** | Repositioned Jan–Mar 2026 as a consumer AI executive assistant; Plus $49.99/Pro $99.99/Max $199.99/mo, no free tier | Personal/executive-assistant-shaped automation (inbox, calls, scheduling) | Consumer/individual framing, not a delivery pipeline for a repo or a client's backlog; no verification layer at all |
| **CrewAI** | 47.8k+ GitHub stars, 27M+ downloads, 150+ enterprise customers, open-source framework + paid "AMP" enterprise platform ($25/mo Professional, $50–150k/yr Enterprise) | Role-based multi-agent orchestration — a framework a developer builds *with*, not a product an agency buys as a finished service | This is infrastructure a competitor could use to build something Handsel-shaped, not a finished competitor itself. Same relationship as LangGraph: a potential substitute for our own orchestration code, not for the product |
| **Zapier Agents** | GA in 2026, 8,000+ pre-built integrations (incl. SAP/NetSuite/Workday), "AI Guardrails," bring-your-own-model | Goal-oriented agents wired into Zapier's existing automation graph | Same shape as Relevance AI — integration breadth is the moat, not verification. Neither ships escrow, independent grading, or a signed proof of what shipped |

**What none of the four do, which is the actual gap the operator's table was
reaching for:** none of them price, escrow, or independently verify a
*specific deliverable* before paying for it — because none of them separate
"the agent ran" from "the agent's output was checked by something other than
the agent." They sell agent *capacity*; Handsel's Repo Care sells a **graded
PR** — money moves only after independent verification. That is the same
distinction §6b of this document already drew against GitHub Copilot's coding
agent (a worker without a market); the addition this pass makes is that the
"AI workforce" SaaS category is a worker **with** a subscription business
model and no market either. Confirms rather than changes the existing
threat ranking.

**Cursor Cloud Agent** (formerly Background Agents) was also checked, since
the operator's table cited it alongside Copilot: confirmed live, opens
merge-ready PRs from a cloud VM, and — per the Cursor community forum,
2026 — background agents spawned via the API still cannot post PR comments,
reviews, or issue operations without extra plumbing. Functionally the same
slot as Copilot's coding agent already covered in §6b: a well-resourced
worker, still no market, still no independent grader, still nothing that
transfers to the next job. Not re-scored as a separate threat.

## What this pass changes

1. **Nothing about the ranked threat list in "Honest threat ranking" above.**
   Virtuals ACP, ERC-8004, a well-funded fintech, GitHub itself, and
   UbiquityOS/Algora remain the five in that order — the AI-workforce SaaS
   category and the verify-then-pay papers both land in a **different
   fight**: they compete for how the *product is described and sold*
   (§7–8 of `docs/positioning.md`), not for the *market mechanism* this
   document tracks.
2. **One correction the operator's own table should carry forward**: do not
   describe RAILS/TessPay as prior art already "5/10 taken" — they are
   unshipped research, and the honest read is that Handsel is ahead of
   published academic proposals on the exact axis (real settled money) that
   would make either of them a threat once someone builds one.
3. **The "Agency Delivery OS" framing is now checked against its real
   competitors** (Relevance AI, Lindy, CrewAI, Zapier Agents) rather than
   only against agent-market and agent-payment projects. All four sell agent
   capacity with no independent verification of a specific deliverable —
   which is exactly the wedge §6b and the "Honest threat ranking" already
   named, now confirmed from a different direction.

# Sixth pass, 2026-09-16 — Aomi Labs: the execution-harness category, and what was taken from it

*Prompted by an operator pointing at [github.com/aomi-labs](https://github.com/aomi-labs)
and asking what, if anything, applies. Method as always: every claim below was
fetched (org page, READMEs of `aomi`, `skills`, `docs`, `aomi-sdk`,
`liqsteward`, `eliza-plugin-aomi`, and the raw `aomi-transact` SKILL.md and
SECURITY.md) rather than carried from memory. Nothing here was run.*

## What Aomi is

Aomi Labs describes itself as "the best blockchain harness for agentic AI —
on-chain execution with runtime, skills, and component library." Concretely,
across ~32 public repos, the product is:

- **A chat → transaction runtime** (`aomi`, TypeScript monorepo): a headless
  React runtime and widget, a TypeScript client and `aomi` CLI, and a backend
  that turns a prompt ("swap 1 ETH for USDC", "bet $100 on Polymarket") into a
  *queued wallet request* the user signs. Account-abstraction-first (EIP-7702
  on Ethereum, ERC-4337 with Alchemy/Pimlico on L2s), with **batch fork
  simulation before signing** (`aomi tx simulate tx-1 tx-2`) and "drain-vector"
  annotations that block, for example, a recipient that is not `msg.sender`.
- **A plugin runtime** (`aomi-sdk`, Rust): third-party APIs wrapped as
  "intent-shaped tools" (`search_*`, `get_*`, `build_*`) compiled to native
  `.so`/`.dylib` plugins that the backend **hot-loads via `dlopen`**, polling
  a release tarball whose `manifest.json` carries per-plugin SHA-256s.
  Official apps: DeFi, Polymarket, Kalshi, Para, social.
- **Agent Skills** (`skills`): `aomi-transact` (drive the CLI) and
  `aomi-build` (scaffold a plugin from an OpenAPI spec), installable with
  `npx skills add aomi-labs/skills` into Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini.
- **Two governance-shaped deployments**: `liqsteward`, which plans vault
  mitigations and emits *unsigned* Safe transaction JSON ("neither LiqSteward
  nor Aomi is the curator, signer, custodian, or broadcaster"), and
  `eliza-plugin-aomi`, whose "wallet-backed confirmation" stops every write
  at an exact preview, requires a separate confirmation turn **from the same
  user who initiated**, and ignores any LLM-supplied confirmation flag.

Vital signs are small: 13 stars on the main repo, 7 on `skills`, active daily
commits through 2026-09-16, MIT throughout.

## Where it sits relative to Handsel

**Not a competitor for the market mechanism.** Aomi has no escrow, no
independent grader, no verdict, no credit score, no market — it is the layer
*below* an agent's wallet: how an agent's intent becomes a signed transaction
safely. In this document's taxonomy it is closest to §3 (payment rails,
complementary) and to the "worker without a market" slot of §6b: a very good
way for an agent to *act* on-chain, with nothing that says whether the action
was the right one or pays anyone for it.

**Adjacent in one specific way that matters to us.** Handsel already holds an
ERC-4337 Kernel account per agent and sends UserOps on its behalf
(`lib/onchain/account.ts`). Aomi is what a *self-custodial* agent would use to
do the same thing from its own wallet. If Handsel ever lets an agent bring its
own account to the market instead of using the platform-held one, Aomi's CLI
is one of the obvious things that agent would be holding. That is a future
integration surface, not a present overlap.

## What was taken

**The skill security manifest — adopted.** `aomi-labs/skills` is the first
skill repo this document has seen that ships, per skill, an OWASP Agentic
Skills Top 10 `permissions:` block (`files` / `network` / `shell` / `tools`,
explicit paths, `deny_write` on `SOUL.md`/`MEMORY.md`/`AGENTS.md`), a
`risk_tier` (L0–L3), and a `SECURITY.md` walking AST01–AST10 with the control
for each and the ones still open, plus captured third-party scanner reports.
Handsel ships four authored skills, one of them a public package strangers
install to earn and spend real USDC, and none of them said what it was
allowed to touch. All four now do; `tests/skill-manifests.test.ts` keeps the
manifest and the skill from drifting apart (an allow-listed host the skill
never names, a literal host in `scripts/` the manifest omits, a tier the two
halves disagree on). Details in `docs/security-audit.md`, "Skills as an
attack surface". We did not adopt the scanner reports — running them is a
real step, not a paragraph, and is listed as open.

## What was considered and not taken, and why

1. **Fork simulation before every send.** Aomi simulates a batch on a forked
   chain before signing and refuses on any failure. Handsel's UserOps already
   pass through the bundler's `eth_estimateUserOperationGas`, which in practice rejects a
   reverting `callData` before anything is broadcast, and `lib/onchain/
   custom-errors.ts` decodes the contract's own error out of that rejection.
   More to the point, Aomi's drain-vector guards protect against **free-form
   calldata composed from third-party data** (a swap route from an
   aggregator). Handsel composes no such calldata: every write is a fixed
   `LaborMarketV2` method whose recipient is the contract's own rule
   (escrow to the market, release to the worker, bond back to the worker).
   There is no recipient field for a hostile brief to steer. A pre-send
   `eth_call` would add a second simulation of the same thing, not a new
   guard.
2. **Confirmation bound to the initiator, LLM flags ignored.** Handsel's
   money step is already a *separate tool call* (`confirm_delegation` after
   `plan_delegation`; `release_job`; `decide_session_approval`), and
   `confirmDelegationJobs` checks the delegation belongs to the calling
   account before it posts anything. No tool takes a "the user said yes"
   boolean. What Handsel cannot do — and neither can Aomi's MCP-shaped
   surfaces — is see whether the human between the LLM and the tool actually
   approved; the Eliza plugin can, because it owns the chat turn. Same
   posture, different substrate; nothing to port.
3. **Hot-loaded native plugins.** This is the one thing Aomi does that
   Handsel has explicitly decided not to: hosting and executing other
   people's code. `docs/coordination-layer.md` and `docs/external-grading.md`
   both refuse it for the same reason — it inverts "we don't run your code",
   and a `dlopen`'d `.so` from a 5-minute poll is the strongest form of that
   inversion. Aomi's SHA-256-per-plugin manifest is the right control *if*
   you have chosen to run the code; we have not.
4. **`npx skills add`-style distribution.** Aomi installs from a GitHub repo
   via a community CLI. Handsel already has three install paths for the
   public package (marketplace layout, `install-skill.sh`, direct download),
   and the `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` layout is what that CLI discovers, so
   `npx skills add Kairose-master/handsel` should already work. Not verified
   this pass — the environment refuses arbitrary npm execution — so it is
   not claimed.

## What this pass changes

1. **Nothing in the threat ranking.** Aomi is infrastructure an agent brings
   to a market, not a market.
2. **One control adopted, repo-wide**, on a surface (skills) this document's
   companion `security-audit.md` had never listed. That is the useful kind of
   landscape finding: not "they are ahead" but "they did the obvious thing
   and we had not."
3. **A named future integration surface**: an agent bringing its own
   Aomi-signed account to Handsel instead of the platform-held Kernel. Filed,
   not planned.
