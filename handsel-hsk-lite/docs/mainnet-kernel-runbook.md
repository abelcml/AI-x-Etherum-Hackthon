# Base mainnet, kernel mode — the ordered runbook

`docs/mainnet-deploy.md` is the reasoning: what can cost you money, why the fee is
shaped the way it is, how the two gas layers must be ordered. Read it once —
noting that its arbiter/oracle guidance is superseded by §2.5 below (they must
be the SAME address in the current code). The mainnet-vs-testnet split lives
in `docs/deployments.md`.

This is the sequence, in order, with the reason each step comes where it does.
Every value here was verified rather than recalled; where something was read off a
chain or out of the code, it says so.

## Why a new deployment, not a repoint

Three deployments end up existing, and that is correct:

| | chain | role |
|---|---|---|
| `ai-agent-credit-dashboard` (v1) | Ethereum Sepolia | V1-contract archive |
| `handsel-nu` | Base Sepolia | testnet, permanently |
| **new** | Base mainnet | the real market |

**Not v1's code.** Checked: v1 has no `contracts/src/LaborMarketV2.sol`, no
`lib/onchain/labor-v2.ts`, no custom-error decoding, no market clock, no wired
mainnet guard. Deploying mainnet from it would re-ship every defect fixed since.

**Not `handsel-nu`'s database.** The credit score is the product's claim, and on
Base Sepolia it was earned with free tokens — `creditScore 670`, `creditLimit
60000`, both verified on chain. A mainnet inheriting that DB would let the first
agent borrow real money against a limit earned for free, which is the
self-Sybil problem in `docs/self-sybil-attack.md` arriving on day one. Mainnet
starts at a genuine cold start, the way the testnet requester still reads
`score 0, limit 0`.

**Not `handsel-nu` itself.** Kernel mode had executed zero times when this was
written; mainnet job #1 (2026-07-30) was its first full run. Repointing the
only testnet would have left nowhere to find that out.

## New secrets, and why the owner key especially

```
DATABASE_URL                 new Neon project
AGENT_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY      NEW — see below
ORACLE_PRIVATE_KEY           new (same value as owner if keeping one key)
API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_SECRET    new; must differ per deployment, it decrypts that
                             deployment's own DB. Set once, never rotated.
```

The owner key matters most. Agent addresses derive from it, so reusing the
testnet key would give the same `agentId` the same address on both chains — and a
testnet key is handled loosely by definition. A leak there would then be a
mainnet loss. This is a bigger separation than the arbiter, whose authority is
bounded to misdirecting a *disputed* job's escrow between worker and requester
(read from `resolveDispute`: it cannot pay itself).

## 1. ZeroDev, mainnet project

Separate project from the testnet one. Never reuse.

The project for this deployment exists. Its paymaster is
`0xEB49a384cCeAA47238d97cb1Dc5629e3f624e4d3`, and reading it on Base mainnet
rather than taking it on trust:

| read | value |
|---|---|
| bytecode at that address, chain 8453 | 4422 bytes — a `VerifyingPaymaster` |
| `entryPoint()` | `0x0000000071727De22E5E9d8BAf0edAc6f37da032` (v0.7) |
| `owner()` = `verifyingSigner()` | `0xEcbC06bD5E6EceBed60196E469b7559fFC584479` — ZeroDev's, not ours |
| `getDepositInfo(pm).deposit` at the EntryPoint | **0** |
| same address on Base Sepolia | no contract |

**Mainnet-only, and the $10 is not an on-chain deposit — and it is not reaching
the paymaster either.** The deposit above reads zero, and asking the project to
sponsor a real operation returns `AA21 didn't pay prefund` from
`pm_getPaymasterStubData`. An operation that names a paymaster makes the
PAYMASTER owe the EntryPoint's prefund, so a deposit of zero fails precisely
there.

The chain read alone was written off here as ambiguous — a provider might fund
the deposit just in time, and an empty deposit looks the same either way. It was
not ambiguous; it was correct, and the sponsorship attempt is what showed it. A
balance in a dashboard is an accounting entry. `getDepositInfo(pm).deposit` is
whether anything can actually be paid.

**Sponsorship does not work on this project today.** That does not block steps 2
through 6: contracts are deployed by an EOA paying its own gas, and the paymaster
is not involved until agents transact. Take it up with ZeroDev — whether the
sandbox balance covers mainnet at all, and what funds the paymaster's deposit —
while the rest proceeds.

**What a UserOp costs**, measured at block 49316999 (base fee 0.005 gwei;
ETH/USD 1916.07 from the Chainlink feed on Base) rather than estimated:

| gas | ETH | USD |
|---|---|---|
| 300k | 0.0000018 | $0.0035 |
| 500k | 0.0000030 | **$0.0058** |
| 800k | 0.0000048 | $0.0092 |

L2 execution only — Base's L1 data fee is extra, small enough post-blobs that the
honest figure comes off the first real receipt. At 500k gas the grant is about
**1,700 operations**, or ~300 full job cycles at five to six ops each.

So $10 is not tight. What is wrong is the shape of the app's budget, not its
size. **Everything in this table describes the day sponsorship is turned ON;
the live mainnet config is `PAYMASTER_DISABLED=true` and none of it is in
force today:**

| setting | value | why |
|---|---|---|
| `SPONSOR_GRANT_TOTAL_USD` | **8** | the axis the app was missing — every other budget is a 24h window, and a window cannot see a total. $5 + $2 a day is ~1,200 ops, so two days empties a grant nobody refills. $2 of headroom against ZeroDev's own accounting |
| `USER_LANE_GAS_BUDGET_USD` | **0.50** | ~87 ops/day, ~14 user-side job cycles — fourteen days of runway at full burn |
| `KEEPER_LANE_GAS_BUDGET_USD` | **0.20** | ~35 ops/day against a sweep bounded at 6 calls a pass |
| ZeroDev daily cap | **0.001 ETH** | ≈$1.9 at $1,916/ETH, about 200 operations — above the app's ~120, so the app degrades first. **The field is denominated in ETH, not dollars.** Entering `1` there is not a dollar; it is roughly two thousand of them |
| per-sender rate | 300/day | keeper does ≤6 calls per 5-minute pass |
| per-UserOp ceiling | **0.00005 ETH** | ≈$0.10, ten times the measured 0.0000049 |
| gas price ceiling | 0.1 gwei | ~14× the measured 0.007. Above this the paymaster stops and accounts self-pay, which is why kernel accounts need a float |
| contract allowlist | leave OFF until step 4 | there is nothing to allow yet, and a list that matches nothing refuses everything |

The grant ceiling splits the way the daily lanes already do: the user lane stops
at `USER_GRANT_SHARE` (75%, so $6 of $8) and degrades to self-pay, and the last
quarter is reachable only by the keeper. Someone who burns sponsored gas costs
the operator money; someone who thereby stops `expireOpen`, `reclaimJob`,
`expireReview` and `expireDispute` freezes everyone else's escrow — the worse
failure, and the one the split exists to prevent.

Then `PAYMASTER_METERED=true` — the acknowledgement, not the policy. The guard
refuses every money path without it.

### Funding the paymaster deposit does not, by itself, buy sponsorship

`AA21 didn't pay prefund` invites exactly one move: put ether in the paymaster.
That was tried — 0.005 ETH into `0xEB49a384…24e4d3` — and it changed nothing but
the balance. The deposit went from 0 to ~890× what one operation needs and every
request returned the same AA21.

Two things this does NOT mean, both of which were asserted here and were wrong:

- **It is not an unsupported path.** ZeroDev exposes self-funded paymasters on
  this plan, at an 8% premium, with a withdraw beside the deposit. The 0.005 ETH
  came back in full.
- **It is not lost.** See above. The earlier text here said an EntryPoint deposit
  can only be withdrawn by the account holding it and that the account was out of
  reach; the first half is true and the second was not, because the dashboard
  calls it for you.

What it does mean is that the sponsorship decision is not made from the deposit.
The feature is marked experimental and returned the same AA21 through the
provider's own UI, so the error is theirs to explain. Ask them, and do not
conclude anything about your configuration from it.

None of this blocks steps 2 through 6: contracts are deployed by an EOA paying
its own gas, and the paymaster is not involved until agents transact. If the
answer is slow, `PAYMASTER_DISABLED` in `.env.example` runs the market without
one.

### CDP accepts Kernel accounts; the monthly figure is a limit, not a credit

Confirmed against the real endpoint on Base mainnet. `pm_getPaymasterStubData`
for a counterfactual Kernel v3.1 sender returned **`payment method not found`** —
which is the answer to the question the Base docs do not cover, because reaching
a billing check means the chain, the EntryPoint version, the sender type and the
contract allowlist were all accepted first. A provider that rejected Kernel
accounts would have said so earlier.

So the only blocker reached in that probe was billing. "$10 monthly gas
sponsorship limit" is a ceiling on what may be charged, not a balance that was
granted; with no payment method behind it, nothing is sponsored. **Status as
of 2026-07-31: after the card was registered, both CDP endpoints rejected our
request shape (`Missing or invalid parameters`) and the integration remains
unresolved — mainnet runs with no paymaster at all.**

Worth contrasting with the same condition at the other provider, which surfaced
as `AA21 didn't pay prefund` — a funding error, for a billing cause, that
survived actually funding the paymaster's on-chain deposit. One sentence versus
two hours.

### A policy that was never saved refuses everything

Worth knowing before reading any error from this project: **an unsaved policy is
not an absent policy, it is a deny-all.** Saving one with no restrictions is what
means "allow every transaction" — so the permissive-looking state and the
refuse-everything state are the same screen, distinguished only by whether the
button was pressed.

That refusal does not arrive as a policy message. It arrives as
`AA21 didn't pay prefund`, which reads as a funding problem and is not one, and
which continued to arrive unchanged after the paymaster's deposit was funded.

Do not save an empty policy to make this go away. An unrestricted paymaster on a
real chain is the operator's money, spendable by anyone who can cause an
operation, and it is what `PAYMASTER_METERED` exists to make you acknowledge.
Save the bounded one.

### Neither the paymaster nor the bundler has to be ZeroDev's

They arrived behind one URL — `ZERODEV_RPC` is both — which made a broken
paymaster look like a choice between keeping account abstraction and keeping
sponsored gas. They are separate services. Paymaster communication is ERC-7677
(`pm_getPaymasterStubData` / `pm_getPaymasterData`), viem ships a generic client,
and a Kernel account does not care who signs the sponsorship.

```
PAYMASTER_RPC=https://api.developer.coinbase.com/rpc/v1/base/<key>
BUNDLER_RPC=https://api.developer.coinbase.com/rpc/v1/base/<key>
```

The same value twice, because CDP serves both roles from one url. Unset, nothing
changes: `BUNDLER_RPC` falls back to `ZERODEV_RPC` and the testnet keeps working.
`PAYMASTER_DISABLED` still wins over both.

`ZERODEV_RPC` named a vendor for a role, and that cost nothing while the vendor
supplied both roles. It cost something the moment the paymaster moved — pointing
at CDP meant setting a variable named for a competitor, or not being able to
leave. The name was the lock-in, not the code.

One trap worth naming, because it is the shape of everything else here:
`BUNDLER_RPC` set to CDP with no `PAYMASTER_RPC` resolves to NO paymaster, not to
ZeroDev's client aimed at CDP. Only ZeroDev's own URL gets ZeroDev's client.
Otherwise one provider's request shape would go to another and the confusion
would read as a refusal.

Two things to establish before relying on it, neither of which the Base docs
answer:

1. **Whether it sponsors EntryPoint v0.7 with a non-Base-Account sender.** The
   CDP guides are written around Base Account; this market's agents are Kernel
   v3.1. `scripts/check-sponsorship.mjs` answers it in one run — it builds a real
   counterfactual Kernel account and resolves the same three variables the app
   does.
2. **The contracts allowlist.** CDP sponsorship is allowlist-based, so the market
   and registry have to exist first. That makes this a step-7 task, not a step-1
   one — which is the same ordering mistake as turning on ZeroDev's allowlist
   before there was anything to put in it.

### Confirm the project before deploying anything

```bash
ZERODEV_RPC=<the mainnet project URL> node scripts/check-sponsorship.mjs
```

Asks the bundler which chain it is on, which EntryPoint it accepts, and — the
part that matters — asks the paymaster to quote sponsorship for an unsigned
operation. Sends nothing and spends nothing; a quote is not an operation.

This is deliberately not a deposit read. The deposit read for this paymaster
returned 0 while the account balance was $10, because a deposit that a provider
funds just in time and a paymaster that is genuinely dry look identical on chain.
Asking it to quote is the question whose answer differs between the two.

With the default throwaway sender, a project whose allowlist is already narrowed
will refuse — and that refusal is a PASS for the allowlist. Re-run with
`--sender <a provisioned kernel address>` after step 7 to see it quote.

## 2. Database

Create the Neon project, then run `docs/schema-bootstrap-single.sql` in its SQL
editor. One statement, 44 tables. Verify with:

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
```

**44** is correct — the number of `CREATE TABLE` statements in that file, counted
rather than recalled.

45 was written here, on the reasoning that migrate.mjs's bookkeeping table makes
one more. It does, but only when you run migrate.mjs; the bootstrap file does not
contain it, so the SQL-editor path ends at 44 and is complete. Two lines apart,
this section said both numbers.

## 2.5 The addresses, before any of them is immutable

`arbiter`, `feeRecipient`, `feeBps` and `flatFee` have no setters. Check them
while checking is still cheap:

```bash
ORACLE_ADDRESS=0x… ARBITER_ADDRESS=0x… FEE_RECIPIENT=0x… DEPLOYER_ADDRESS=0x… \
node scripts/preflight-addresses.mjs
```

Addresses only — never a key. It reads balances and code size, and refuses two
combinations that deploy perfectly and fail later:

**`ARBITER_ADDRESS` that is not the oracle.** There is no `ARBITER_PRIVATE_KEY`
anywhere in this codebase; `resolveDispute` is signed by `oracleWallet()`
(`lib/onchain/labor.ts`). Separating the arbiter from the oracle — which reads
like good key hygiene — makes every dispute unresolvable, and nothing shows it
until the first dispute, because posting, accepting and settling all work.
They must be the same address — and `deploy-labor-v2.mjs` warns when they are,
which is also correct: one leaked key then forges credit scores, rules on
disputes, and can call `setOracle`. Both warnings are true. Separating them for
real is a code change — an `ARBITER_PRIVATE_KEY` and a second wallet client in
`resolveDispute` — not a config choice. Until that exists, equal is the only
combination where disputes resolve at all.

Note that no script here reads `.env`. There is no `dotenv` dependency; every
deploy script reads `process.env` directly, so the values that matter are the
ones exported in the shell you run it from. Deleting `.env` does not clear a
stale `MIN_DELIVERY_WINDOW_S`; a new terminal window does, and passing every
variable on the command line does it per-invocation.

**`FEE_RECIPIENT` that is a contract with no way to call `withdraw()`.** Fees are
pulled, not pushed. An address that cannot make a call cannot be paid, and the
money accrues correctly and permanently out of reach.

## 3. Registry

Before this step ran, `CREDIT_REGISTRY_ADDRESS` was still Base Sepolia's — a
mainnet market pointing at it would publish scores to a contract on another
chain, which fails rather than lying, but fails late. The mainnet registry
this step produced is `0x91acc4c081d3a364d3b713be8eec39a77f647290` (see the
Deployed table below).

```bash
ONCHAIN_CHAIN=base ONCHAIN_RPC_URL=... DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=... \
ORACLE_ADDRESS=<new oracle address> \
node scripts/deploy-registry.mjs
```

## 4. Market

```bash
ONCHAIN_CHAIN=base \
ONCHAIN_RPC_URL=... \
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=... \
USDC_ADDRESS=0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913 \
CREDIT_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=<from step 3> \
ARBITER_ADDRESS=<new oracle address> \
FEE_BPS=500 FLAT_FEE=30000 FEE_RECIPIENT=<YOUR OWN WALLET — see below> \
BOND_BPS=500 FLAT_BOND=30000 \
node scripts/deploy-labor-v2.mjs
```

### `FEE_RECIPIENT` is the revenue, and it is immutable

`feeRecipient` is `immutable` — written by the constructor, no setter, forever.
Whatever address is passed here owns the entire fee stream for the life of the
contract, and the only remedy for a wrong one is a redeploy.

**Do not use the oracle address.** The runbook said to, and that was wrong for
what this address is. The oracle key lives in Vercel's environment so the server
can sign `resolveDispute` — a hot key, on a machine, rotatable precisely because
nothing irreversible depends on it. Making it the fee recipient welds the
revenue to it: the key can no longer be rotated without abandoning every dollar
credited to the old address, and anyone who reads that env reads the takings.

Use a wallet you hold the key to and the server does not — a hardware wallet or a
MetaMask account. Then:

- fees accrue to it with no involvement from the deployment at all
- the server never has the ability to move them
- you collect with `withdraw()`, or `withdrawTo(anywhere)` if you want them
  somewhere else

That wallet needs a cent or two of ETH to call `withdraw` — it is not an agent
kernel account, so the paymaster does not cover it.

### How the fee behaves, read off the deployed testnet contract

| | |
|---|---|
| `feeBps` | 500 (**5%**) on mainnet — `MAX_FEE_BPS`, the ceiling. Immutable. The testnet contract reads 200 |
| `flatFee` | 0.03 USDC |
| charged | at `postJob`, on `bounty + feeOn(bounty)` |
| credited | `withdrawable[feeRecipient] += fee` — never transferred, so a blocklisted recipient cannot stop the market accepting work |
| refunds | `expireOpen`, `reclaimJob`, `expireReview` and `cancel` all credit back `job.bounty` **only** — the fee is not returned. A job that never completes has still paid |

Live on Base Sepolia at `0xd9bcf174…04a09`: `jobCount 2`,
`withdrawable[feeRecipient] 0.064 USDC` — 2 × 0.032, exactly the two postings.

### What it earns against what it spends

One completed cycle is roughly five UserOperations (requester approve+post
batched, worker approve+accept batched, submit, approve, withdraw) — self-paid
from each kernel's ETH float while `PAYMASTER_DISABLED=true`, sponsored only
once a paymaster is live. At the measured $0.0058 that is about **$0.029 of
gas per job**, against a flat fee of **$0.03**.

That is not a coincidence — `flatFee`'s own comment says it covers the gas
envelope while `feeBps` prices the value at risk. But it means the margin at
micro-bounties is the 5% and nothing else:

At `FEE_BPS=500`:

| bounty | fee collected | gas spent | margin | requester's overhead |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | 0.035 | ~0.029 | ~0.006 | **35%** |
| 1 | 0.08 | ~0.029 | ~0.051 | 8% |
| 5 | 0.28 | ~0.029 | ~0.25 | 5.6% |

The flat fee is what makes the small end expensive, not the rate: 0.03 on a 0.1
bounty is 30 points of that 35%. Raising `feeBps` fixes the large end and leaves
the small end where it was, so if micro-jobs are meant to be a real segment the
lever is a minimum bounty, not the rate.

The five-op count is read off the flow, not measured. Step 8 measures it, and if
it comes in higher than five the flat fee is under water at the smallest
bounties — `FLAT_FEE` is immutable too, so that is the same pre-deploy decision.

`USDC_ADDRESS` read from chain 8453 and confirmed: `USD Coin` / `USDC` /
**6 decimals**. Six matters — every bounty, cap and fee is scaled by a
compile-time 6, and `decimalsBlocker` exists because an 18-decimal token would
escrow a $5 bounty as $5,000,000 without erroring.

**Pass no window overrides.** The script's defaults are open 60d, delivery
4h–30d, review 1d, dispute 14d. A stale `MIN_DELIVERY_WINDOW_S=600` in the shell
is how the Base Sepolia contract got a 600-second floor.

Then verify before trusting it:

```bash
node scripts/verify-bundle-labor-v2.mjs <new address> --rpc <mainnet rpc> \
  --tx <the deployment transaction hash>
```

`--tx` is worth passing. Without it the script reads eighteen getters one at a
time and a public endpoint answers `over rate limit` partway through; with it,
the constructor arguments come from the deployment transaction's input in a
single request — the creation bytecode this script just reproduced, followed by
the arguments exactly as the chain received them. It also proves that
transaction deployed this code.

That reproduces the creation-bytecode keccak, compares runtime code with the 15
immutables masked, and emits the Basescan standard-JSON plus constructor args read
back from the chain.

### Deployed — Base mainnet, 2026-07-30

| | |
|---|---|
| AgentCreditRegistry | `0x91acc4c081d3a364d3b713be8eec39a77f647290` |
| LaborMarketV2 | `0x96064ef0a6742d5b7bc8abf2584273bd2f022c8c` |
| creation keccak | `0xf9e4abc1…0bc3bcd` — reproduces the committed source |
| runtime | 8943 bytes local and on chain, 15 immutables masked |
| fee / bond | 5% + 0.03 USDC / 5% + 0.03 USDC |
| delivery window | 14400s floor (4h), 30d ceiling |

The creation keccak matches the Base Sepolia deployment's, which is what identical
source and identical solc settings are supposed to produce.

## 5. Vercel

New project, `handsel` repo, plus everything above and:

```
ONCHAIN_CHAIN=base
USDC_ADDRESS=0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913
LABOR_MARKET_ADDRESS=<step 4>
CREDIT_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=<step 3>
ARBITER_ADDRESS=<new oracle address>
ZERODEV_RPC=<step 1>            # serving the BUNDLER role only today (BUNDLER_RPC is the current name)
PAYMASTER_DISABLED=true         # the live config — no sponsorship; satisfies the metered ack
PAYMASTER_METERED=true          # applies instead of PAYMASTER_DISABLED the day sponsorship turns on
SPONSOR_GRANT_TOTAL_USD=8
USER_LANE_GAS_BUDGET_USD=0.50
KEEPER_LANE_GAS_BUDGET_USD=0.20
PLATFORM_FEE_BPS=0
FAUCET_MAX_PER_DAY=0
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
```

`PLATFORM_FEE_BPS=0` is not optional. `platformFeeBps()` **defaults to 200**, so
leaving it unset charges 2% off-chain on top of the contract's 5% + 0.03 and
every requester pays twice. That is the `fee-charged-twice` blocker.

`FAUCET_MAX_PER_DAY=0` only became a real off switch recently — the parse was
`Number(x) || 15`, so an explicit zero fell through to fifteen.

## 6. Confirm before touching money

```bash
curl -s https://<new>/api/capabilities | python3 -m json.tool
```

Wanted:

```
runtime.agentAccountMode   "kernel"
runtime.bundlerConfigured  true
runtime.marketIsV2         true
runtime.realMoney.isRealMoney  true
runtime.realMoney.blockers     []
blocking                        []
```

A non-empty `blockers` names what to change and why. `unevaluated` listing the two
fee codes means the contract read failed, so they were neither passed nor
enforced — fix the RPC and re-check rather than proceeding.

## 7. Provision, and fund two things

Press Provision on each agent: kernel addresses differ from EOA ones, and
`provisionSmartAccount` overwrites the stored address unconditionally.

Then fund:

- **each agent's kernel account with USDC** — a requester with none cannot escrow,
  a worker with none cannot post a bond
- **each agent's kernel account with a few cents of ETH** — the self-pay float.
  With `PAYMASTER_DISABLED=true` this is not a fallback: **every mainnet UserOp
  pays from this float today**, so size it for the traffic you expect. Nothing
  tops it up automatically, because `ensureAgentGas` spends the oracle's ether
  and is gated by the same budget it would be escaping

The oracle wallet is what the floats are dripped FROM, so it needs ETH for
that as well as for `resolveDispute` (a cent or two a call). The day a
paymaster is live, agent gas moves off the oracle and it needs ETH for
rulings only.

## 8. One cycle, small

Bounty 0.1 USDC. Post → accept → submit → grade → approve → withdraw, and watch:

- `jobCount` 1, `totalEscrowed` 0.1
- the batch landing as ONE UserOp (kernel batches atomically; EOA sends in order)
- `gas_spend` recording a `user` lane row — the kernel path's first metered op
- `LimitUpdated` on the new registry

This cycle ran on 2026-07-30 and completed: job #1, bounty 0.1 USDC, status
Completed at block 49332461 — `withdrawable[worker] 0.135` (bounty + bond
back), `withdrawable[feeRecipient] 0.035`, worker total 0.5 → 0.6. It was
kernel mode's first execution anywhere; keep this section as the repeatable
smoke test for deployment #2 and beyond. If something fails here it will most
likely be in the transport, and `explainOnchainError` decodes the contract's
custom errors with their arguments, so the reason arrives as a sentence rather
than "execution reverted for an unknown reason".
