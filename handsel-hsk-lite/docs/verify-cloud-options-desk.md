# Running the Cloud Options Desk once, end to end

Everything shipped for the office — the four verified MCP servers, `assisted`
mode, the `[mcp-query]` fix, the review round-trip, per-step payers, the MCP
tool surface — is green on `tsc`, `lint`, the test suite and a production
build, and **has never been executed once**. This is the shortest path from
that to a memo you can read.

Written by tracing the code paths this specific desk takes, not by summarising
`.env.example`. Where a requirement is non-obvious it says which file makes it
one.

## Two things a first run hit, both now fixed

Recorded because the runbook below did not predict either, and both were
silent.

**`hire_office` wired nothing.** `hireOfficeTemplateFor` called `setMcpWorker`,
a server action, inside a try/catch. An action resolves its caller from the
session cookie and the MCP path has none, so it threw, was caught, and the
hire returned success with six unwired agents — every reader a plain platform
agent answering from memory. Fixed (it calls `setMcpWorkerFor` with the userId
it already has) and the result now names any role that should have a connector
and doesn't.

**Hired roles had no on-chain wallet.** `hire_office` created agents and never
provisioned them, and `lib/auto-mine.ts` refuses an agent with no
`smartAccountAddress` — so a role could not claim even the job reserved for it
by `assignedAgentId`. Confirming would have escrowed, left six jobs unclaimable
until the 30-minute reservation lapsed, and handed them to whoever was watching
the public board. Fixed: each role is provisioned at hire, and any role that
comes out without a wallet is reported as loudly as an unwired connector.

Neither could be caught by tsc, lint, the test suite or the build. Both were
caught by running it and then reading the roster.

## The thing most likely to surprise you

**Two of the six roles are not MCP workers.** The Architect and the Red Team
are `platform` agents, and `lib/agent-tasks.ts:157` dispatches those to
`startAgentTask` → **`AGENT_RUNTIME_URL`**, the Python worker runtime
(`agent-runtime/`, default `http://localhost:8000`).

So "the connectors need no key" is true and does not mean the desk needs
nothing. Without that runtime the four vendor reads complete and the desk
**stalls at step 5 of 6** — which looks like the review gate hanging, and
isn't.

## Gas: an address is not the ability to use one

Where the deployment sponsors no gas — no paymaster, or `PAYMASTER_DISABLED`
— every agent pays from its own kernel account, and a freshly provisioned
account holds nothing. `lib/onchain/account.ts` refuses below a
**0.00005 ETH** floor, so such an agent cannot accept a job **including one
already escrowed for it**.

This is what actually stopped the first run, after every other blocker was
cleared: four vendor readers, correctly wired and provisioned, with $6.84
locked against them, failing every claim on `holds 0 wei, under the floor`.

Two ways out, and they are the operator's choice:

- **Send each agent a little ETH.** 0.00005 is the floor; 0.0002 covers a
  working session. `provision_office` now names any agent that has an address
  and no ETH, with the address, so this is a transfer rather than an
  investigation.
- **Configure a paymaster** (`BUNDLER_RPC`/`ZERODEV_RPC`, `PAYMASTER_METERED=true`)
  and gas is sponsored — which is the operator's money, so the budget
  variables in `.env.example` Tier 3 come with it.

## Preflight

### Required — the desk cannot run without these

| Variable | Why this desk needs it | Symptom if missing |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Everything | Nothing loads |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | Sessions. Unset falls back to the library default, i.e. forgeable | App boots, sessions insecure |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL` | The origin the callback posts back to | Worker results never land |
| `API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` | Decrypts stored keys and MCP auth headers | "Stored API key could not be read" |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | Your login | No admin |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | **Three separate consumers here:** the LLM verifier that grades every deliverable, `resolveLlm` behind `assisted` mode, and the runtime's own key for the two platform agents | Readers fail to write; nothing grades |
| `AGENT_RUNTIME_URL` | The Architect and the Red Team (see above) | Desk stalls after the four reads |
| `ONCHAIN_CHAIN` + `ONCHAIN_RPC_URL` | `sepolia` or `base-sepolia` | No provisioning |
| `AGENT_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY` | The signer behind every agent account | `isAgentAccountConfigured()` false |
| `LABOR_MARKET_ADDRESS` | `isLaborMarketConfigured()` | Confirm cannot post |
| `USDC_ADDRESS` | Your deployed MockUSDC on testnet | Escrow reverts |
| `BUNDLER_RPC` **or** `AGENT_ACCOUNT_MODE=eoa` | `isAgentAccountConfigured()` needs one or the other (`lib/onchain/config.ts:233`) | Agents cannot transact |

### Deliberately NOT required

- **A key for any of the four MCP servers.** AWS Knowledge, Microsoft Learn,
  Cloudflare Docs and Exa all answered anonymously
  ([`office-connectors.md`](office-connectors.md)).
- Everything in Tier 4+ of `.env.example`: GitHub App, EAS, vault, paymaster
  budgets, Solana. None of it is on this path.

### The one setting that changes the shape

`REQUIRE_USER_API_KEY=true` makes **the account's own key mandatory** rather
than falling back to the platform's — in Settings, before hiring. Note the two
paths disagree in their error text, so this is worth getting right up front:
`resolveLlm` says *"Planning needs an LLM key"* and `resolveUserAnthropicKey`
says *"Add your Anthropic API key in Settings to run agent tasks"*. Same cause.

## The run

**0. `/doctor`** for the self-check, then confirm the two things it does not
cover: `AGENT_RUNTIME_URL` answers, and `/office` loads.

**1. One funded agent.** Create it, provision it (Profile → On-Chain), mint
test USDC. It pays for all six steps unless you split the bill.

**2. Test one connector.** Office → Staff & connectors → **Test**, or from
Claude Code, `test_mcp_connector`. Expect: reachable, and *"sends its input as
`search_phrase`"*. **This is the cheapest possible check that the whole MCP
path works** — if it fails, stop here; nothing downstream can succeed.

**3. Hire.** Office → Hire a template office → Cloud Options Desk. The
connector rows arrive pre-filled; leave them. Budget $12 (six steps, the
architect weighted 2 — the dialog will show it escrows $12.00). Nothing is
escrowed by this step.

Six agents are created, each provisioning a smart account. Expect this to take
a minute and to cost gas.

**4. Read the plan on `/delegate` before confirming.** This is where the work
so far becomes checkable:

- Four reads with no dependencies; the Architect depending on all four; the
  Red Team marked *reviews Architect*.
- If you set a shared source, each brief carries it.
- If you split the bill, the steps you reassigned say **paid by X**.

**5. Confirm.** Money moves here and only here.

**6. Watch.** Auto-mine sweeps are traffic-driven, not cron — keep `/delegate`
open, or the sweep will not run.

## What each stage proves, and how it fails

| Stage | Proves | Failure signature |
|---|---|---|
| Test button | Handshake, tool exists, argument key | "advertises no tool called…" — a rename upstream |
| The four reads deliver | `assisted` mode: tool called, model wrote from it | A raw JSON result dump as the deliverable = the agent is in `proxy`. Check the roster line |
| Reads name their sources | `[mcp-query]` sent the short query | Vendor-irrelevant pages quoted = the whole brief went as the query |
| Architect delivers | `AGENT_RUNTIME_URL` is reachable | Stalls with four reads done — the failure above |
| Red Team returns APPROVE/REVISE | The review gate | Escrow held with no verdict = the reviewer never got dispatched |
| A REVISE goes back to the Architect | The round-trip, **the least-tested thing here** | `/delegate` shows "revision 1 — back with the worker". If it instead sits at "still not approved… your call" on the first REVISE, `decideRevision` was reached with a spent round count |
| Escrow releases on approve | `approveJob` signed by the payer | An on-chain revert here means the job's requester and its payer disagree — the bug the per-payer commit fixed |

## What the first live check actually proved (2026-08-26)

Run against the deployed connector from Claude Code, before any money moved.
This closes part of the list below; the rest is still open.

**Verified:**

- `list_office_templates` returns all six templates (nine as of 2026-09-04 —
  `securities-floor` and others were added after this pass) with the Cloud
  Options Desk's four connectors attached, and the Due Diligence Desk's gate
  renders as
  *"REVIEWS partner — a REVISE goes back to that worker"*. The MCP tool surface
  works against the real deployment, not just in tests.
- `test_mcp_connector` → AWS Knowledge answered: reachable, *"a job would
  arrive in its `search_phrase` argument"*, *"takes a single string, so it works
  as a worker"*. Deployed app → `probeMcpTool` → a real third-party server, end
  to end.
- `office_roster` returned real wiring for a real account.

**Found, unprompted, by looking:**

- An agent wired before modes existed sits in **`proxy` on Exa** —
  `web_search_exa … (submits the tool's output as-is)`. That is the exact
  defect `assisted` mode exists for, live in an ordinary account: it would
  submit a search-result dump as its deliverable and fail grading, with the
  failure booked against a worker that retrieved correctly. Evidence that the
  mode default matters in practice, and that the roster line is worth reading.
- Its URL carries `?tools=web_search_ex` — one character short of
  `web_search_exa`. **Not our truncation:** `mcpServerUrl` is an unbounded
  `text` column and nothing in the codebase slices it, so it was entered that
  way. Exa ignores the malformed filter and still answers, which is why it went
  unnoticed. A papercut, not a failure.

**Still not run:** the hire, the confirm, and everything downstream of them —
which is the whole list below.

## What I would not trust until it has run

Honestly ranked, most to least likely to be wrong:

1. **The revision round-trip.** Only the pure `decideRevision` and the two
   brief builders are tested. Re-dispatching the worker, re-pointing
   `jobSpec.agentTaskId`, and re-running the reviewer are tick-path code with
   no coverage.
2. **`assisted` mode's real output.** The prompt is tested; whether a 24 KB
   Microsoft Learn envelope actually produces a sourced answer is not.
3. **Six concurrent provisions.** Nothing here has hired six agents at once.
4. **The `[mcp-query]` line surviving assembly.** Tested as a string, not
   through a real `postOneSubtask` with the DSL prepended and the shared
   source appended.

Everything above the line in this file is derived from code. Everything in this
list is derived from the absence of a run.
