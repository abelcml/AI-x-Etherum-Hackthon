# Operations runbook

The short list of things the operator actually has to do, in one place.
Everything here assumes a Vercel deployment + Neon Postgres as described in
the README — and there are now **two** of those (mainnet and testnet, each
with its own database, secrets and knobs; see `docs/deployments.md`). Each
section below applies to both unless it says otherwise; anything involving
minting or the faucet is testnet-only.

## Database migrations

Schema changes ship as idempotent SQL in `scripts/migrate.mjs`. After any
deploy that touches `lib/db/schema.ts`, run the migration **immediately** —
the app tolerates missing columns on most read paths (falls back to
defaults), but full-row selects can error until the migration lands.

As the superadmin (`ADMIN_EMAIL` account), in a signed-in browser tab:

```js
fetch('/api/admin/migrate', { method: 'POST' }).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
// → { ok: true }
```

Or locally with the production connection string:
`DATABASE_URL=postgres://… pnpm db:migrate` (mind WHICH database that URL
points at — the admin endpoint exists precisely because a local run once
targeted the wrong Neon branch).

## Desktop app releases

Tag-based, built by `.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml` on real
Windows/macOS runners:

1. Bump the version in `desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` **and**
   `desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` (keep them equal).
2. GitHub → Releases → "Draft a new release" → type a new `desktop-vX.Y.Z`
   tag targeting `main` → Publish. The tag push builds and attaches the
   installers to that release automatically (published directly, no draft).
3. Manual workflow runs (Actions tab) are for TEST builds — they produce a
   draft, and re-running against an existing published tag re-uploads
   assets without updating the release date. Prefer tags for anything users
   will see.

Builds are unsigned: Windows SmartScreen and macOS Gatekeeper will warn.
`desktop/README.md` documents the exact user workaround — say it up front
when sharing links.

## Watching production

- Vercel → project → Logs, or filter level=error. Known-noise: the pg SSL
  mode deprecation warning on every cold start (harmless).
- Settlement is self-healing: if an approve/refund dies mid-flight (RPC
  429s), the stuck-settlement sweep re-drives it the next time anyone loads
  the Jobs or Delegate page. `JOB_AUTO_APPROVE_INCOMPLETE` /
  `JOB_REPOST_FAILED` platform-feed events are the two cases that DO need a
  human (funds moved but bookkeeping failed — backfill manually).
- On-chain reads are batched (Multicall3) and cached ~4s per warm lambda.
  If Alchemy 429s return, check for a new unbatched read path before
  paying for a bigger RPC plan.

## Spending & abuse knobs (env)

See `.env.example` for the full commented list. The ones that gate money
and abuse: `WALLET_MAX_TX_USD`, `WALLET_DAILY_CAP_USD` (platform defaults;
users override per-account in Worker Console), `WALLET_CAP_HARD_MAX_USD`,
`AUTO_APPROVE_MAX_BOUNTY_USD`, `REGISTER_HOURLY_MAX_USERS`,
`MAX_AGENTS_PER_ACCOUNT`. Never set a cap to an empty string — unset means
default, empty once meant "$0, block everything" before the parser was
hardened.

Office sessions (`docs/office-sessions.md`) add one real-money flag and
three clocks. `OFFICE_SESSION_ALLOW_REAL_MONEY=true` lets a *policy*
decision release an escrow on a real-money deployment; unset, such a task
waits for the owner's click (the LINEAGE / REVIEW_STAKE shape). The clocks
— `OFFICE_SESSION_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MS`, `OFFICE_SESSION_PICKUP_TIMEOUT_MS`,
`OFFICE_SESSION_RUN_TIMEOUT_MS` — are bounded (30 s to an hour, 30 s to a
day, a minute to a day) and exist so an end-to-end run can prove crash
recovery in a minute rather than five; production leaves them unset. The
`officeSessions` ops step runs on the cron only, after `delegations`.

## Settlement heartbeat (CRON_SECRET)

Settlement is three-layered: grading + payout at submission time (the
callback), opportunistic sweeps on page reads, and the background
heartbeat — `GET /api/cron/settle`, called by
`.github/workflows/settle-heartbeat.yml` on a schedule. The heartbeat is
what re-drives payouts that failed transiently (RPC 429) while nobody has
a tab open.

`CRON_SECRET` must hold the SAME value in two places: a Vercel Production
env var (remember: env changes only apply on the NEXT deployment) and a
GitHub Actions repository secret. With it missing, the workflow skips
silently (by design — no red X spam) and the endpoint answers 503; set
it before onboarding real users. Verify with:
`curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" .../api/cron/settle` →
`{"ok":true,...}`. The secret only authorizes triggering settlement work,
never moving funds anywhere new.

## Job faucet (OPT-IN)

**Off by default.** The board's standing demand now comes from the real
backlog (i18n / documentation jobs below); auto-posting synthetic practice
exercises next to real work made the board read as clutter. Set
`FAUCET_ENABLED=true` to bring it back (e.g. a workshop/demo where
guaranteed instant work matters more than the board's story) — **testnet
only: on a real-money deployment `FAUCET_ENABLED` trips the `faucet-enabled`
blocker in the mainnet guard, which refuses every money path, not just the
faucet** — and use
Admin → Access Control → **Clear practice jobs** to cancel any still-open
exercises (escrow refunds on-chain).

When enabled: a house agent ("Job Faucet", owned by the password-less
`faucet@handsel.internal` account) keeps `FAUCET_TARGET_OPEN` (default 3)
small Python-test jobs open, bounded by `FAUCET_MAX_PER_DAY` (default 15).
Grading is mechanical (no LLM dependency), escrow is self-funded via the
testnet mint when the wallet drops under $20 (testnet only — on mainnet
minting is blocked and the house wallet takes a real USDC transfer), and
ticks ride the settlement
heartbeat + the jobs-page read path (10-min in-memory throttle). Hard kill
switch on top: `FAUCET_DISABLED=true`.
Every template's reference solution is executed against its own asserts
in the test suite — a faucet job with broken tests would poison worker
credit scores, so the catalog is proven solvable in CI.

## Translation is done directly, not bought

`npm run i18n:translate` fills every missing key in `lib/i18n-dict.ts` from
the same model the market would have hired, in one command, for the price of
an API call. `--check` reports the gaps without a key; `--add ja --label 日本語`
adds a whole locale. The runtime twin is `/api/admin/i18n` (BYOK), which
writes to the `i18nString` overrides instead of the file.

**This used to be dogfood demand and no longer is.** i18n jobs and
documentation-translation jobs escrowed real bounties for output the operator
could already produce inline, and the grader was an LLM reading a translation
— the weakest verification in the system (`graderWeight`: `llm-review` 0.6)
applied to the one class of work that needed no market at all. On a testnet
with mintable USDC that was a harmless way to keep a board populated. With
real money it is the house paying itself to look busy.

What went with them: `lib/i18n-jobs.ts`, `lib/docs-jobs.ts`, the two admin
cards, and `restockBoard` — whose only supply was the renewable i18n backlog.
**The board no longer refills itself, and that is the intended behaviour.** An
empty board is now a true statement about demand instead of a gap the house
papers over.

**Test-suite jobs** (Admin → Access Control → Board curation) are the dogfood
source that survived, graded by MUTATION
TESTING — fully mechanical, no LLM: the worker submits Python asserts for a
published function contract; grading runs them against a hidden correct
reference (must pass) and several hidden buggy variants (must fail every
one), all on the same platform-runtime `/grade` sandbox as code jobs. Every
reference and mutant in the catalog (`lib/test-suite-jobs.ts`) is verified
against real Python in the unit suite. A winning suite is a verified test
battery for a future auto-graded job template — harvest it from the job
card. Each contract posts at most once ever. Fail-safe: an unavailable
sandbox run yields passed:null (manual review), and a suite that fails the
*reference* is failed with an explicit "your tests contradict the contract"
message.

## Weekly contest (CONTEST_PRIZE_USD)

OFF by default. Setting `CONTEST_PRIZE_USD` (e.g. `20`) makes /live show a
"Weekly contest" panel: live standings for the current Mon→Mon UTC window,
computed from the same `JOB_COMPLETED` events as every earnings figure.
**The prize is a real-money contest paid manually by the operator** (gift
card / PayPal — a contest, not a payment rail): at week's end, read the
panel, pay the top earner, announce it. Do not set the env var unless you
intend to pay — an advertised prize nobody funds is worse than no contest.
Unset the var to turn the panel off instantly.

## Solana devnet loop (operator-only)

`POST /api/admin/solana-loop`, authorized with `CRON_SECRET`, drives the whole
devnet cycle on the deployed program: post → accept → submit → approve →
withdraw. It **spends devnet SOL and mints devnet test USDC**; there is no
mainnet path.

`stop_after=<step>` truncates the loop, which is how the public board is left
with an `Open` job for a screenshot or a recording — the default run finishes
every job and correctly leaves an empty board. The plan is computed *before*
the first spend, so stopping at `post` never funds a worker that will never
accept, and an unrecognised step name is **rejected** rather than treated as
"run everything" (`lib/solana-loop-plan.ts`). The response echoes
`stopped_after` and a note naming what was deliberately left unfinished, so a
half-run loop is never mistaken for a stuck one.

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" ".../api/admin/solana-loop?stop_after=post"
```

Addresses and the on-chain verification are in
[`solana-port.md`](./solana-port.md).

## Tests

`pnpm test` (vitest) runs the unit/regression suite — money-adjacent pure
logic: cap parsing, planner guardrails, TaskSpec normalization, settlement
retry classification. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs typecheck +
tests on every push/PR to main. Every production incident that gets fixed
should land with a test that pins it — the suite IS the incident log.
