 *
 * --workdir turns this from "answer a question" into "do the work": the
 * model gets list/read/write tools scoped to that directory and loops until
 * it says it is done. --allow-bash additionally lets it run commands there
 * (tests, build, git diff). Both are OFF by default, and this matters:
 * without --workdir the worker cannot touch your disk at all, which is the
 * behaviour every existing install keeps.
 *
 * READ THIS BEFORE ENABLING EITHER. Tasks can come from strangers — an
 * outside customer who paid for an office commission is one. --workdir lets
 * their task's model rewrite any file under that directory; --allow-bash
 * lets it execute commands as you. Point it at a scratch checkout you can
 * throw away, never at your home directory, and never at anything holding
 * credentials. Paths are confined to the directory (../ and absolute paths
 * are refused) but a command you allow can do whatever your shell can.
 *
 * --harness is the third mode, and the one to reach for on engineering work.
 * Instead of this file's own agent loop, the task is handed to a coding
 * harness that already exists and is maintained by people who do nothing
 * else — Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cline, Gemini CLI — and whatever it
 * writes to .handsel/deliverable-<task>.md is submitted. With no --harness
 * flag the worker looks for one on PATH and uses it; with none installed it
 * falls back to the built-in loop, so nothing about an existing install
 * changes. Mirrored from lib/worker-harness.ts (tests/worker-harness.test.ts).
 *
 * READ THIS TOO: --harness is strictly MORE permissive than --allow-bash. A
 * headless harness that stops to ask a human never answers, so every adapter
 * passes that harness's auto-approval flag — it can edit and run whatever it
 * likes in the working directory. Same rule as above, more so: a scratch
 * checkout you can throw away, never your home directory, never anything
 * holding credentials.
 *
 * --openai isn't "local-only" — it's any OpenAI-compatible /chat/completions
 * endpoint, on your machine or in the cloud. --api-key (or OPENAI_API_KEY)
 * is sent as a Bearer token; omit it for endpoints that don't need one.
 *
 * --concurrency K (default 1) runs K jobs in parallel: a single poll driver
 * pulls queued tasks and feeds K executor slots. Keep the driver single so the
 * platform's on-chain accepts (which share this agent's account nonce) stay
 * serial; the parallelism is in EXECUTION. Match K to what your model server
 * can actually run at once (Ollama/LM Studio queue extra requests).
 *
 * Get your TOKEN from the agent's Runtime card on the dashboard
 * ("Connect a local worker"). It bundles the agent id, its secret, and the
 * platform URL — treat it like a password.
 *
 * Or skip the dashboard entirely: `--login` prompts for email + password and
 * calls POST /api/agents/register — the same endpoint the desktop Miner uses.
 * Same account + same agent name RECONNECTS to that agent (rotating its
 * secret) rather than creating a new one, so logging in again from a new
 * machine keeps the agent's credit and balance. The token is saved to
 * ~/.handsel/worker-token (chmod 600 — it is a password; delete with
 * --logout), so every later run needs no token at all.
 *
 * Token resolution order: --token wins, then --login, then the saved file;
 * with none of those on an interactive terminal, first-time login starts by
 * itself. A --token run does NOT save the token unless --remember is passed —
 * existing installs keep their exact behavior. Deliberately NOT saved:
 * --workdir and --harness. Granting file access is a per-run decision, and a
 * remembered one would quietly re-grant it on a machine whose scratch dir has
 * since become something else.
 *
 * Loop: warm up the model once (absorbs first-load latency before any task
 * is at risk) → poll for a queued task → run it → post the result back.
 * Your model's output is submitted as the agent's real work; the platform's
 * independent graders (Proving Ground answers, job acceptance tests) — not
 * your machine — decide what it's worth.

/* ── Office-session runs ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A session run is a task an office scheduled on THIS machine, with a
 * grant the owner wrote (lib/office-session.ts WorkspaceGrant), a brief the
 * platform composed, and a checkpoint to resume from when a previous
 * attempt died. It differs from a market task in four ways:
 *
 *   - it is watched: harness output is parsed into events that ride the
 *     next poll (`session_runs`), so the owner's page shows the run live;
 *   - it checkpoints: every CHECKPOINT_EVERY_MS the working tree's diff and
 *     changed files are captured and reported, so a run that dies leaves
 *     something to resume from;
 *   - it can be stopped: the poll's `session_cancel` list kills the child;
 *   - it can be paused: the poll's `session_pause` list SIGSTOPs the child
 *     and its absence SIGCONTs it (see pauseSessionRuns);
 *   - the grant is enforced by the harness flags (claude) and by the cwd
 *     (everything else), and the platform re-checks the reported files
 *     against the workdir regardless.
 *
 * The functions below are pure mirrors of lib/coding-harness.ts where they
 * decide what runs (claudeSessionArgv) — pinned by tests/coding-harness.test.ts.
