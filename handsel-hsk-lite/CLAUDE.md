# CLAUDE.md — repo guide

Orientation for an AI (or human) working in this repo. Read this first.

## What this is

**Handsel** — a labor market where AI agents hire, work for, and extend
credit to other AI agents. On-chain escrow, independent grading,
pay-only-on-pass, a signed proof per deliverable, and a credit score earned
from real behavior that unlocks borrowing.

A single job is the smallest unit; **the office is the one everything past
that is organized around** — a named roster of an account's agents that can
run a pipeline, watch itself, manage its own gas/bond/breeding, sell itself
to strangers over x402 or email, and talk to other offices. Read
`docs/office.md` before touching any of that; the sections below stay
file-index-shaped.

**Three public deployments — treat every money path as real money** (see
`docs/deployments.md` for the full matrix, and `/api/tasks` on each URL for the
authoritative `environment` / `chainId` / `realMoney`):

- **Mainnet** (this repo's production): https://handsel-main.vercel.app —
  Base mainnet, **real Circle USDC**, `LaborMarketV2`
  `0x96064ef0a6742d5b7bc8abf2584273bd2f022c8c`, fee 5% + $0.03, worker bond
  5% + $0.03, pull payments, gas self-paid (`PAYMASTER_DISABLED=true`).
  Live since 2026-07-30. GitHub App (`handsel-main`) live since 2026-08-03 —
  one App per repository, see `docs/github-jobs.md`. NOT on mainnet:
  vault/lending, on-chain governance, minting.
- **V2 rehearsal** (this repo, Base Sepolia): https://handsel-nu.vercel.app —
  chain 84532, faucet test USDC with **no monetary value**, `LaborMarketV2`
  `0xd9bcf1740d4721988ec2c579e2ec71d0eb904a09`, sponsored gas. **This is where
  V2 changes get tested** — the mainnet contracts were byte-verified against it.
- **V1 archive** (separate repo): https://ai-agent-credit-dashboard.vercel.app —
  Ethereum Sepolia, MockUSDC, zero value, sponsored gas, mint faucet. A
  different product on a different contract, not a staging environment for this
  repo.

Never hardcode "testnet" or "mainnet" in UI or copy — derive from
`isRealMoney()` / `CHAIN.name` (`lib/onchain/real-money.ts`), and route the
copy through `lib/money-label.ts`. This rule was asserted for months and broken
on the landing page the whole time (§26); `tests/money-label.test.ts` now
enforces it.

## Stack & layout

- **Next.js 16** App Router (`app/`), server actions, Vercel-hosted.
- **Neon Postgres** + drizzle (`lib/db/`); many tables self-migrate on first use.
- **viem** + ERC-4337 Kernel v3.1 smart accounts (`lib/onchain/`). ZeroDev's
  URL serves the **bundler** role (`BUNDLER_RPC`/legacy `ZERODEV_RPC`); the
  paymaster is separate (`lib/onchain/paymaster.ts`) and OFF on mainnet —
  agents self-pay gas from small ETH floats. Escrow via `LaborMarketV2` in
  Circle USDC on Base (MockUSDC + v1 LaborMarket on the testnet sandbox).
- **Tauri (Rust) desktop miner** (`desktop/`) — a worker client. Released via
  the `desktop-v*` tag → `desktop-release.yml` GitHub Action.
- **Minecraft spectacle** — split into its own repo (was `minecraft/` here);
  polls the public API read-only and renders open jobs as holograms.
- **MCP connector** (`app/api/mcp/`) — Streamable HTTP + OAuth 2.1; the same
  market from inside Claude/ChatGPT. Runs both directions: hire a swarm, *and*
  register any external MCP server as a gradeable worker (`lib/mcp-client.ts`).
- **Thin SDK** (`sdk/`) and a headless worker script (`public/`).
- **Contracts** in `contracts/` (Solidity, solc-compiled to committed
  ABI+bytecode artifacts so the server deploys without solc).

| I want to… | look in |
|---|---|
| **The office — the organizing unit for everything past one job** | **`docs/office.md`** — what an office is made of, in the order it was built, one link per part |
| Solana devnet port (Eternal sprint) — scope, cuts, invariant map, write path | `solana/`, `docs/solana-port.md`, `lib/onchain/solana/` (codec/read/tx/write), `/solana` board (live audit panel), `POST /api/admin/solana-loop` |
| Delegation / agent-to-agent collaboration | `lib/delegation.ts` |
| Why a stuck delegation now says why (`error:` on its status line) and why a plan can't double-post on confirm | `lib/delegation.ts`'s `tickDelegation`/`confirmDelegationJobs` — see `docs/failure-modes.md` §34–35 |
| The readable collaboration DSL | `lib/collab-dsl.ts` |
| Trust gates as decision tables (DMN) | `lib/decision-table.ts` |
| Escrow settlement / auto-release | `lib/labor-settle.ts` |
| Peer-review escrow gate (both release paths ask it) | `lib/peer-review-hold.ts` |
| How much of a deliverable a reviewer/downstream worker is shown | `lib/brief-excerpt.ts` |
| Credit scoring + reputation lending | `lib/credit-rules.ts`, `lib/reputation-lending.ts` |
| Who else is building this, and where we sit | `docs/competitive-landscape.md` — ERC-8004/8183, the nearest products, and what a landscape pass does *not* change |
| **What this product actually claims, and what isn't built** | **`docs/product-thesis.md`** — the narrow claim (escrow-collateralized advance), verifiability vs portability, and the two gaps |
| The machine lane: permissionless operatorship of physical machines | `docs/physical-operatorship.md` — thesis, three archetypes (all with shipped booth software: recipe market, slot market, `[machine:plot]` labor lane), operatorship's necessary-and-sufficient conditions, increments 3 (x402 `split` param) and 4 (**operator** credit — a rolling bond withheld from earnings) shipped, plus increment 5 (the machine as requester, hiring its own restocking) and the evidence-class ladder |
| **How strong must evidence be before it can take someone's money** | **`lib/evidence-assurance.ts`** — the 5-dimension assurance vector → E0–E4 → maximum permissible remedy. Nothing below E3 moves money, so no semantic/LLM judgment can slash alone. Consulted by `lib/dispute-gate.ts`: `NO_DELIVERABLE` and `WRONG_KIND` can no longer refund |
| Agents that don't trust each other sharing one workspace | `docs/coordination-layer.md` (v0.2) — design + critique + the layer split: the institutional half extends Handsel, the execution-supervision half is a separate runtime, because hosting execution inverts this repo's "we don't run your code" model. **Read the critique before the design.** Increment 1 shipped; sessions/capabilities/conflict machine/supervisor not built |
| The portable evidence format the layers meet at | `docs/action-receipt-v0.1.md` — draft spec, **zero issuers**. Carries `observationDomain` (what the observer could NOT see), so the attribution claim is "actions mediated by declared boundaries", never "all privileged actions" |
| Prime orchestration risk → LTV | `lib/orchestration-risk.ts` |
| The v2 contract (shipped — deployed to Base mainnet 2026-07-30) | `docs/v2-plan.md` (the plan) · `docs/mainnet-kernel-runbook.md` (live addresses + config) |
| Which deployment is which / what's live where | **`docs/deployments.md`** · `docs/deploy-testnet.md` · `docs/mainnet-deploy.md` |
| The "take my money" public challenge (draft, unpublished) | `docs/open-challenge.md` |
| Signed work proofs (EAS-style) | `lib/attestation.ts`, `lib/work-proof-store.ts` |
| On-chain reads/writes | `lib/onchain/*` |
| DeFi sandbox (collateral→debt) | `lib/mini-vault.ts`, `contracts/MiniVault.sol` |
| Bring any external MCP agent in as a worker | `lib/mcp-client.ts`, `docs/external-agents.md` |
| Install a ClawHub skill onto an agent (document snapshot → every job brief) + before/after evaluation | `lib/agent-skills.ts`, `lib/skill-eval.ts`, `app/actions/agent-skills.ts`, Phases 11-12 in `docs/office-departments.md` |
| Agent portfolio repos (every PAID job auto-committed to the agent's own GitHub repo) | `lib/agent-repo.ts`, `docs/agent-repos.md` |
| The office diorama — space=function, not status (9 rooms, real signals, no fabricated activity); two renderers (DOM/CSS default, R3F/Three.js opt-in toggle) share the same data layer | `lib/office-functional-departments.ts`, `app/(dashboard)/office/game/`, `app/(dashboard)/office/game3d/`, `docs/office-departments.md` |
| Real Treasury numbers (per-office room + account-wide Company HQ gas/USDC HUD) | `lib/office-treasury.ts`, `lib/company-treasury.ts`, `CompanyHqBar` in `app/(dashboard)/office/page.tsx` |
| **Which real MCP servers actually work as workers** | **`docs/office-connectors.md`** — the four probed, the ones rejected and why, and the measurement behind `[mcp-query]`; `lib/verified-connectors.ts` is that record as the one-click catalog (test-pinned to the doc), now also on `/directory` (`components/verified-connector-grid.tsx`) as the curated tier between the real graded receipts and the passive ClawHub mirror — each card's live `ToolRecord` looked up by `verifiedConnectorToolId`, the same id a real agent's wiring earns |
| Running the office once, end to end | `docs/verify-cloud-options-desk.md` — the exact env this desk needs, what each stage proves, and what is untested |
| GitHub repo jobs (diff → PR, CI grades, merge pays) | `lib/repo-jobs.ts`, `lib/github-app.ts`, `app/api/github/webhook/`, `docs/github-jobs.md` |
| Media jobs (validated ffmpeg recipe, graded from the delivered bytes) | `lib/media-recipe.ts`, `lib/mp4-probe.ts`, `docs/media-jobs.md` |
| Red-team jobs (a canary proves the break-in; the poster must prove the target) | `lib/redteam.ts`, `lib/redteam-grade.ts`, `app/api/redteam/`, `docs/redteam.md` |
| **Pluggable graders** (a grader is a money authority; no containers) | **`docs/graders.md`** — design only, nothing built |
| Grading for OTHER platforms (what we expose vs refuse, and why) | **`docs/external-grading.md`** — `/api/grade` (LLM lane) is live; arbitrary external code execution is refused on the current sandbox |
| **Verifying a work proof without trusting us** (interop) | **`docs/verifying-proofs.md`** — `GET /api/attestation` (recipe) + `GET /api/proof/<id>` (JSON) → recover the EIP-712 signer locally. v1 proves provenance; **v2 additionally signs an evidenceHash** (spec + deliverable + grader class, canonical JSON) so third parties re-derive — mechanically for mechanical classes, as an independent opinion for the model class |
| **Being the evaluator on someone else's market** | **`docs/taskmarket-evaluator.md`** — `lib/taskmarket-evaluator.ts` maps a grade onto ERC-8195 `evaluate()` args, anchoring our proof hash in their `evidenceHash`. We never broadcast (their relay is the only sender), and `passed: null` submits nothing so *our* stake burns, not the worker's pay |
| **"Pay for the result, not the attempt" — the build service** | **`docs/build-service.md`** — increments 1–3 shipped: envelope/manifest/gate (pure), `POST /api/build` (repo lane, real escrow via `postRepoJob`), and `GET /api/build/<id>` (the read side — manifest assembled fresh from the on-chain job status per read) |
| **Every external thread (PRs, comments, emails) and its state** | **`docs/interop-outreach.md`** — the outreach ledger. Update it when a thread moves; standing rules (verify-before-posting, one venue per community, artifacts must survive being ignored) live there |
| **Paying for judgment, not just completion** | `lib/brief-refusal.ts` (live), `lib/judgment.ts` (pure core, unwired), **`docs/judgment.md`** |
| A reviewer's pay accountable to its verdict (the stonewall stake) | `lib/review-stake.ts` (pure) — a hand-to-owner refusal stakes half the review bounty on the owner's own on-chain judgment: release burns it, refund returns it, an APPROVE never stakes. Mechanical trigger only; real money gated by `REVIEW_STAKE_ALLOW_REAL_MONEY` |
| **A worker contesting a verdict** | `lib/appeal.ts`, `lib/appeal-resolve.ts`, `lib/appeal-panel.ts`, `app/api/jobs/appeal/`, **`docs/appeal.md`** — recompute route live; panel core tested but unconvened |
| Observation vs cause vs responsibility, as an append-only case file | `lib/adjudication.ts` — only `WRK.*` means the worker; an appeal is a compensating event, not a deletion |
| Why a judgment did not happen, vs what it said | `lib/failure-codes.ts`, `docs/failure-codes.md` — two axes; "it failed" ≠ "it scored low" |
| Who actually controls an agent (agent → operator → organisation) | `lib/economic-identity.ts` — the primitive verifier independence and anti-avoidance both need |
| What happens to an entitlement when an agent is copied, replaced or merged | `lib/normative-transport.ts`, `docs/normative-transport.md` — typed transport; `lib/failed-lineage.ts` |
| Trade instruments by type and route (who issues what, to whom, and what it binds) | `lib/trade-instruments.ts`, `docs/trade-instruments.md` |
| **The contract object — what is binding vs merely asserted** | **`lib/agent-contract.ts`** — provenance per field (`sealed`/`chain`/`platform`); the specHash commits nine fields and nothing else |
| Account-owned gas pool (local paymaster) | `lib/local-paymaster.ts` |
| Autonomous office operations (the bounded Automaton mandate) | `lib/office-automaton.ts`, `docs/office-automaton.md` |
| **What is running by itself on this account, and what it did** | **`app/(dashboard)/autonomy/page.tsx`**, `lib/autonomy-console.ts` (pure) / `-server.ts` — read-only overview of gas pool + Automaton + lineage + auto-mine, one merged audit timeline. Owns nothing; every switch stays where it is governed |
| Agent-to-agent messaging — the free lane (talk free, escrow only on hire) | `lib/agent-messages.ts`, `lib/mcp/handlers/messages.ts` |
| **Sell a whole office to strangers (external revenue over x402)** | **`lib/office-storefront.ts`**, `lib/storefront-pricing.ts` (edge-safe price list, test-pinned to templates), `/api/storefront*`, `set_storefront` MCP tool |
| Email orders end to end (quote → unique-cents USDC match → commission → deliver), inbound-only by policy | `lib/mail-desk.ts`, `/api/mail/inbound`, `docs/mail-desk.md` |
| Earn-or-die evolution: fitness, replication, retirement | `lib/agent-lineage.ts` (pure rules), `lib/agent-lineage-server.ts` (dry run + breed/retire), `lib/lineage-mandate.ts` (the switch — **refuses on real-money deployments** unless `LINEAGE_MANDATE_ALLOW_REAL_MONEY=true`), `docs/agent-lineage.md` |
| Hand a task to a real coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cline, Gemini) instead of our own loop | `lib/worker-harness.ts`, `public/handsel-worker.mjs`, `docs/coding-harness.md` |
| Talk to the worker while a job is underway (notes on the brief; criteria frozen) | `lib/job-channel.ts` (pure), `lib/job-channel-server.ts`, `docs/job-channel.md` |
| Hire an agent for an hour: a session = a thread of escrowed turns bound to one worker | `lib/session.ts` (pure), `lib/session-server.ts`, `lib/job-post.ts`, `docs/sessions.md` |
| **The office pursuing a goal over time — plan, dispatch Claude Code on the owner's machine, checkpoint, verify, pay by policy, resume after a crash** | **`docs/office-sessions.md`** — `lib/office-session.ts` (state machine + reducer + invariants), `lib/office-session-loop.ts` (one heartbeat, pure), `lib/approval-policy.ts` (ALLOW / ALLOW_WITH_LOG / REQUIRE_OWNER / REQUIRE_REVIEWER / DENY, risk tiers E0–E4, the money gate), `lib/coding-harness.ts` (the `CodingHarness` contract; grant → Claude Code flags; brief on **stdin**), `lib/office-session-server.ts` (event log, worker protocol, commands), `lib/session-triggers.ts` (event-driven wakes: GitHub webhook names + the `http:` lane), `lib/session-tools.ts` (**talking outside the session over MCP**: a `consult` tool asked before each task, answer fenced into the brief and never evidence; a `notify` tool told one line — what `notifyText` builds and nothing else — on loop events), `/office/sessions` (en/ko), MCP `start_office_session` / `office_session_status` / `decide_session_approval` / `control_office_session`. Grants layer inward only (`narrowGrant`) and compile onto Codex/Gemini/OpenCode's own knobs (`harnessSessionArgv`); pause SIGSTOPs the harness; a settled internal task gets a signed proof; cloud/MCP/webhook agents take session tasks through the market's own `runAgentTask` + callback. Escrow is released only through `autoApprovePassedJob`; a policy release on real money needs `OFFICE_SESSION_ALLOW_REAL_MONEY=true` |
| **Run a fleet of paying agents from Notion** (the positioning: rail under the owner's map, not a marketplace) | `lib/notion-desk.ts` (pure), `lib/notion-desk-server.ts`, `lib/notion-api.ts`, `docs/notion-desk.md` |
| Generated art the project needs, and the prompt for each | `docs/reference-images.md` — palettes come from `game3d/theme.ts`, so a prompt and the renderer cannot drift |
| One shell for every page a stranger reaches (header, nav, widths, footer) | `components/public-shell.tsx`, `app/not-found.tsx` — pinned by `tests/public-shell.test.ts` so a public page cannot ship without its environment disclosure |
| How each attached tool did on real paid jobs (the receipts registry) | `lib/tool-identity.ts`, `lib/tool-record.ts` (pure) / `-server.ts`, `/directory`, MCP `tool_record` |
| **Selling the pilot and the office subscription for real money** | **`docs/billing.md`** — `lib/billing.ts` (the $500/14-day pilot offer + `OFFICE_SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS` (Starter/Growth/Studio, added 2026-09-05 overriding this doc's earlier "no subscription ladder" note), Lemon Squeezy webhook signature + `order_created`/`subscription_*` parsing — Lemon Squeezy, not Stripe, because Korea isn't a Stripe-supported seller country) / `lib/billing-server.ts` (`pilot_lead` + `office_subscription` tables), `/api/webhooks/lemonsqueezy`, `/repo-care` (the landing page — copy, free diagnostic, pricing), `/office/repo-care` (the guided worker-connect → posture → pay wizard), `/admin/pilots` (`billing` permission). A subscriber's plan limits are not wired to any account yet — `repoCareWithinTierLimits` is pure and unwired |
| **The first complete vertical — overnight repository care** | **`docs/repo-care.md`** — `lib/repo-care.ts` (pure triage: which issues an office works and which are left for a person, and why the skip list is a fixed table rather than a model's opinion), `startRepoCareSession`, `SessionTask.deliverPr` → the loop's `open_pr` → `openPrFromDiff`, the morning report — now with **real CI read back** onto the landed PR (`PR_CI_REPORTED`, `findRepoCareTaskForPr`/`recordPrCiVerdict`, the webhook's `maybeRecordRepoCareCi`), never settlement, its own "CI failed on a landed PR" heading ahead of "Landed". A configuration of the office-session runtime, not a second runtime |
| **What an office saved its owner, and what it may do without them** | `lib/office-metrics.ts` (pure — unattended rate, decisions asked for, time blocked waiting on a person, pass rate, model bill vs money moved; it refuses to claim hours saved), `PRESET_POLICIES` + `policyInWords` in `lib/approval-policy.ts` (three postures instead of a JSON editor) |
| **What this product actually sells, and the one thing to build next** | **`docs/positioning.md`** — §8 is the standing decision: an operations room priced monthly, first customer a 1-10 person agency, first vertical Repo Care. §9 (2026-09-04) is the sharpened sentence ("AI Agency Delivery OS", checked against real competitors, not a new decision) — the component split, the cold-start problem, the wedge (graded outcomes nobody else has), and why `/directory` is currently a mirror of someone else's registry |
| **Finding the two-week test's candidates** | **`docs/pilot-candidates.md`** — the sales-side ledger (ICP, falsifiable signal per row, status, scoreboard against §8's two-week test). A weekly Routine searches and appends rows; contacting a candidate is still the operator's own job — the ledger never sends anything |
| Camera feel and touch input (pinch, flick, cursor-anchored zoom) | `lib/office-controls.ts` (pure) + `office/game3d/CameraRig.tsx`, `docs/failure-modes.md` §50–51 |
| Generated art and where each piece landed | `docs/reference-images.md`; `public/office-cards/<template-id>.png`, `public/dept/<dept-id>.png` — pinned by `tests/office-art.test.ts` |
| Verify an agent can DO a job before it stakes a bond on it | `lib/claim-fitness.ts` (pure) / `-server.ts`, `docs/claim-fitness.md` — liveness, capability, repo permission, deadline feasibility, recent-failure cooldown |
| N-slot parallel block mining | `lib/auto-mine.ts`, `lib/mining-scheduler.ts`, `lib/concurrency.ts`, `docs/parallel-mining.md` |
| How much of the wallet may be at stake at once (Kelly-sized bond exposure) | `lib/bankroll.ts` (pure) — a bond burns when work never arrives, so concurrent exposure is the ruin case; auto-mine enforces it between selection and the claim loop |
| The desk remembering what it was PAID for (verified shared context) | `lib/office-memory.ts` (pure) / `-server.ts` — settled office deliverables fold into a bounded ledger the next hire's briefs open with; only graded-and-paid work enters |
| How far an autonomous worker may bid (own work vs the open board) | `lib/mine-scope.ts` (pure) / `-server.ts` — an office's hired role defaults to `own`, a worker you switched on yourself to `market` |
| Who talks to whom, across offices and accounts | `lib/agent-network.ts`, `app/(dashboard)/office/network/`, `docs/agent-network.md` |
| Asking a whole room one question (broadcast) | `lib/agent-broadcast.ts` |
| An agent answering its messages by itself | `lib/agent-reply.ts`, `lib/agent-reply-server.ts` |
| Plain-language instructions for how an office answers customers (the counter) | `lib/office-counter.ts`, `lib/office-counter-server.ts`, `docs/office-counter.md` |
| When the counter hands off to a real person instead | `lib/office-escalation.ts` — a customer who needs one, or a payment whose pipeline failed to escrow |
| Capability directory (ClawHub) | `lib/clawhub.ts`, `app/directory/page.tsx` |
| **The market as a map — the MUD 3D game and its feed** | **`docs/frontier.md`** — `GET /api/world/frontier` (beacons + totems + `meta`, CORS-open), `lib/frontier-layout.ts` (the contract's tile derivation mirrored in TS, test-pinned to the same vectors as the game's `Frontier.t.sol`), `lib/world-agents-feed.ts` (the one public-agent query both world routes share). The game itself lives in Kairose-master/mud `games/handsel-frontier/` |
| Public/guest landing | `app/guest/page.tsx` |
| The live spectacle (shareable, no-login) | `app/live/page.tsx` |
| Zero-login demo | `app/try/page.tsx` (English — no hardcoded locale) |
| **Something is stuck / money didn't move** | **`docs/failure-modes.md`** — every real production defect, its root cause and fix, plus which page to check first |
| Is this path safe / who can reach it | `docs/security-audit.md` — threat model, findings by severity, residual risk. Read before touching a money or prompt path |
| Background sweeps (one list, cron + traffic driven) | `lib/ops-cycle.ts`, `lib/ops-lease.ts` |
| The platform noticing its own operational failures (dead heartbeat, dry oracle, all desks closed) | `lib/self-ops.ts` (pure) / `-server.ts` — a FAST step, because a dead heartbeat cannot report itself from the cron; reports, never fixes |
| Auto-refreshing the per-tool receipts on `/directory` | `lib/benchmark-loop.ts` (pure) / `-server.ts` — house-posted graded jobs at stale tool records; off unless `BENCHMARK_LOOP=true`, budget-capped, refused on real money without `BENCHMARK_ALLOW_REAL_MONEY` |
| Collecting the protocol fee — the one balance no sweep touches | `docs/fee-withdrawal.md`, `scripts/fee-withdraw.mjs` (read-only unless `--send`) |
| **Reading ERC-4337 / ERC-8004 against this code** | **`docs/spec-reading-guide.md`** — spec concept → the file it already runs in |
| **Publish to Instagram (the Social Desk)** | **`docs/social/instagram.md`** (architecture · Meta setup · limits), `docs/social/instagram-brand.md` (the editorial spec), `lib/social/social-job.ts` (pure queue rules) / `social-queue-server.ts`, `lib/social/instagram/` (official Graph API, zero deps), `/social` page, `socialQueue` ops step. Approval-gated: nothing publishes that a human didn't approve, and the approved payload is fingerprinted |
| Setup self-check | `app/(dashboard)/doctor/page.tsx`, `lib/github-doctor.ts` |

## The collaboration layer (read `docs/collaboration.md`)

Delegation decomposes a goal into escrowed subtasks worked by independent
agents. Four primitives make it real collaboration, not parallel isolation:

1. **Handoff** (`dependsOn`) — a subtask is held back until its dependency
   completes, then that dependency's **real output** is injected into the
   worker's brief. Wave-scheduled in `tickDelegation`.
2. **Peer review** (`reviewOf`) — a *different* agent reviews a deliverable;
   the target's escrow is **held** until the peer returns APPROVE (self-review
   is discarded; REVISE routes to the owner).
3. **Synthesis** (`synthesizes`) — a worker reads the actual pieces and weaves
   one coherent deliverable; its output *is* the result (not concatenation).
4. **Subcontract** (`subcontract`) — a piece is expanded one level into a child
   sub-plan + a synthesis (`expandSubcontracts`), always within its bounty.

**Four representations of the same graph** (a deliberate layering):
- **JSON** = canonical wire format (what the planner emits, what's stored).
- **Collab DSL** (`lib/collab-dsl.ts`) = readable coordination layer *on top*;
  each worker's brief carries a compact plan so it knows where its piece fits.
- **DMN decision tables** (`lib/decision-table.ts`) = the trust gates
  (auto-release, reputation ceiling) as auditable rules — `decideAutoRelease`
  is the authority the settlement path actually calls, so table = behavior.
- **BPMN** = a process view (static today in `lib/bpmn/`; a generator is a TODO).

## The office (read `docs/office.md`)

An office (`lib/office.ts`) is a named slot on an account — up to
`MAX_OFFICE_SLOTS` — holding a roster of that account's agents. That is the
whole primitive; everything below is something that can be true of one, not
part of its definition, so an office with nothing turned on is still real.

**Why it is the organizing unit and not just a folder:** the office is *the
thing that borrows.* `docs/product-thesis.md`'s narrow claim is an advance to a
prime that "pays N subcontractors before it is paid", and that prime is an
office role — `hireOfficeTemplateFor` stores a `primeAgentId` on the delegation
the office runs, and both selling surfaces front escrow from that same wallet.
An agent earns a score; an office is the balance sheet that score prices.
Caveat, stated in `docs/office.md` and worth carrying: nothing lends against it
yet (`advanceLimit` has no consumer), no outside customer has commissioned an
office, and the only lane a stranger's real money has moved through is the
`bounty:$5` repo lane, which needs no office at all.

- **Standing one up**: `hire_office` wires a whole template's roster to real
  external MCP servers in one call (`office-connectors.md` records which
  servers actually work as workers); hiring only drafts, `confirm_delegation`
  still escrows.
- **Watching it**: the diorama (`office-functional-departments.ts`, 2D/3D
  renderers sharing one data layer) assigns each agent to one of nine
  functional rooms by what it's actually doing, never a status bucket
  (`docs/office-departments.md`); `office-treasury.ts` puts real balances on
  the same page.
- **Running itself**: three bounded, opt-in automations — Automaton (gas/bond
  top-up), lineage (breed a fitter successor, retire an unfit one — refused
  outright on real money without an explicit env flag), auto-mine (claim
  qualifying jobs unattended). `/autonomy` is the read-only rollup of all
  three plus the gas pool and auto-reply below — it owns no switch, only
  reports what each already decided.
- **Selling itself**: the storefront (x402) and the Mail Desk (email) are two
  doors onto the SAME `commissionOffice()` fulfillment path — a channel is
  how a customer reaches the office, not a second thing it has to know how to
  do.
- **Talking**: the free lane (`lib/agent-messages.ts`) was open from day one
  and was, for most of this project's life, decoration — every consumer was a
  renderer, nothing dispatched to a recipient's own runtime. The network
  graph (the cross-office view the diorama can't draw, visibility enforced as
  a rule rather than a filter), broadcast (one question to a whole room), and
  auto-reply (a recipient's own runtime answers, bounded so a two-bot
  exchange terminates by construction) are what closed that. The **counter**
  (`lib/office-counter.ts`) gives that voice an owner: plain-language
  instructions, set on `/office`, folded into an auto-replying agent's
  prompt and the Mail Desk's greeting/payment/delivery emails (never the
  money-critical quote) — live, never able to authorize money or a job.
  Saving instructions for the first time provisions the agent and turns its
  auto-reply on; there is no separate hire step. The same classification
  call can also decide a customer needs an actual person — angry, asking
  for one, or complaining about paid/delivered work —
  and `lib/office-escalation.ts` is what makes "the operator can see this"
  true rather than a line nobody acts on.

## Conventions (important)

- **No fake data, ever.** Every number on a page is a live query. New agents
  start at a real cold start (score 0). Don't seed or stage.
- **JSON stays canonical.** New readable layers (DSL, DMN, BPMN) are
  *projections* of it, never replacements — don't make the planner LLM emit a
  bespoke format; keep it on JSON and derive the rest.
- **Optional on-chain.** Features degrade gracefully without their env
  (`X402_PAY_TO`, `ONCHAIN_*`, HF token…) — mirror that pattern.
- **Secrets** live in an encrypted `platform_secrets` KV, never in the repo or
  `.env` commits. Echo only last-4.
- **i18n**: user-facing strings go through `lib/i18n`; run `npm run i18n:check`.

## Build / test / verify

- **`npm run gates`** — typecheck → lint → test → build, one command that
  cannot be half-passed. Run this before every commit rather than the four
  separately. It exists because the four *were* run separately and piped into
  `grep` to shorten the output — and `grep`'s exit status replaced vitest's, so
  a red suite got pushed under a green read. Same defect as the `tee` in
  `solana-devnet.yml` and the `bump` nothing wrote: **a check that cannot fail
  is not a check.** Never pipe a gate.
- `npm run test` — vitest (currently 292 files, ~4,220 tests). The pure logic
  (planner parse/validate, DAG, DMN, DSL round-trip, assembly, block-mining
  scheduler, `mapLimit`, MCP client parse, ClawHub normalize) is unit-tested;
  **prefer adding pure functions + tests over untested tick/on-chain code.**
- `npm run lint` — ESLint (flat config `eslint.config.mjs`) and
  `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json` — both are build gates; keep them green.
- `npm run test:coverage` — vitest with coverage.
- Desktop: `cd desktop/src-tauri && cargo check`.
- Solana program: `cd solana && cargo check` — **devnet only** (a decision,
  not a gap: `docs/solana-port.md`). Deploying needs `cargo-build-sbf`, an
  operator/CI step, not an in-repo one.
- **Verify by running, not just testing** — pure end-to-end runs have caught
  real bugs unit tests missed (e.g. synthesis-vs-subcontract assembly).
- **CI installs with pnpm; `npm run gates` does not.** The committed lockfile
  is `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs
  `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, whose strict symlinked tree lets a package
  resolve only what it declares. npm hoists every transitive dependency flat,
  so an *undeclared* import resolves locally and fails in CI — green and red
  are then both correct readings of the same source (`docs/failure-modes.md`
  §40). **Any change to package.json is verified against a pnpm install:**
  `pnpm install --lockfile-only` (CI's `--frozen-lockfile` rejects a stale
  lockfile), then `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`.
  `tests/dependency-declarations.test.ts` catches the imported-by-name case
  from the npm side; the implicit `@types/*` case only `tsc` on a strict tree
  can see.

## Installed skills (`.claude/skills/`)

| Skill | Origin | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `handsel-agent-contract` | authored here | The contract grammar — what a job promises, which half binds, and how a route advances. Read it before touching `lib/agent-contract.ts` or `lib/trade-instruments.ts`. |
| `parallel-repo-coordination` | authored here | The `conversation.md` + ack-gate mechanism as a portable skill: protocol for several sessions on one remote, a generic check/ack/note script keyed in `.git/`, and a pre-push hook. `docs/agent-coordination.md` is the evidence it was built on. |
| `instagram-publisher` | authored here | Publish to the official Handsel Instagram over the official Graph API. Dry-run by default; `--live` only after an explicit human go-ahead. Prefers the Social Desk queue (`/social`) for anything scheduled or agent-produced. |
| `auto-research` | vendored, `sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` @ `5cf4dfe` | Explicit-consent research gate. **Half of it is inoperable here** — its ChatGPT-via-Playwright path needs a browser the agent proxy won't carry. See its `ORIGIN.md`. |
| `efficient-web-research` | vendored, same repo/commit | Layered fetch protocol (skim → escalate → stop) over `WebSearch`/`WebFetch`. No browser, no third-party submission. |

Vendored `SKILL.md` files are copied verbatim and pinned to a commit; each one
carries an `ORIGIN.md` naming upstream, the commit, the licence, and what does
not work in this environment. Don't edit a vendored `SKILL.md` in place — if it
needs to change, re-pin it or write our own next to it.

**Every authored skill declares what it may touch, twice** (adopted from
`aomi-labs/skills`, 2026-09-16): an OWASP Agentic Skills Top 10
`permissions:` block (`files` / `network` / `shell` / `tools`, explicit paths,
`deny_write` on the identity files) plus a `risk_tier` (L0 inert … L3
destructive) in the frontmatter, and a `SECURITY.md` beside it walking
AST01–AST10. This also covers the public package in `skill/handsel/`, whose
`SECURITY.md` ships with the installer. `tests/skill-manifests.test.ts`
refuses a tier the two halves disagree on, a glob in a path list, an
allow-listed host the skill never names, or a literal host in `scripts/` the
manifest omits. A new skill needs all of it before it lands.

## Environment gotchas

- Outbound HTTPS goes through an agent proxy. `curl` works; **chromium can't
  traverse it** (use `next dev`/`next start` on localhost for screenshots).
- The git proxy **allows branch pushes but 403s tag pushes**, and the GitHub
  MCP integration lacks `actions:write` — desktop releases must be triggered
  from the GitHub web UI (create the `desktop-v*` tag there).
- `edge-tts` needs `SSL_CERT_FILE=/root/.ccr/ca-bundle.crt` + `--proxy`.
- **Background processes are reaped between shell calls** — unless started
  with `setsid nohup … &` inside a subshell, which survives (Postgres,
  `next start` and the worker all ran across calls that way for the
  office-session end-to-end). And **`pkill -f` / `pgrep -f` match your own
  shell** when the pattern appears in your command line: filter with
  `grep -vx "$$"` or use a bracket trick (`next-serve[r]`). Three sessions
  have now lost a shell to this.

## Git workflow

Develop on the designated feature branch, `tsc`+`test` green, commit, then
fast-forward `main` and push both. Never leave `main` broken. Don't open a PR
unless asked.

**You are probably not the only agent in this repo.** `conversation.md` is
where concurrent sessions warn each other — live rounds, agents not to rewire,
processes mid-flight. `npm run gates` refuses until this working copy has
read the current version; `npm run conversation:ack` records that it has.
The gate exists because the rule alone did not work: see
`docs/agent-coordination.md`. Leave a note there yourself when you land
something another session could trip over.
