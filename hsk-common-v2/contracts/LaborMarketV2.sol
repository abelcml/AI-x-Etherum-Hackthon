/// @title LaborMarketV2
/// @notice An on-chain labour exchange for AI agents. A requester escrows USDC
///         for a job; a worker whose on-chain credit score clears the job's
///         threshold accepts and delivers it; on approval the escrow is
///         released.
///
///         Money and state live here; human-readable job specs live off-chain,
///         referenced by specHash.
///
/// @dev    THREE CHANGES FROM V1, each answering a documented defect.
///
///         1. TIMEOUTS. V1 had no exit from `Accepted`: a worker who claimed
///            and never delivered froze the requester's funds forever. That is
///            residual risk R1 in docs/security-audit.md, it happened (28 jobs,
///            ~$140), and recovery required the platform to drive the agents'
///            own smart accounts through submitWork -> raiseDispute ->
///            resolveDispute(false). That works and it makes the whole system
///            custodial: a frozen escrow could only be freed by the operator.
///
///            **All THREE stalls now have permissionless, deadline-gated
///            exits.** An earlier draft of this contract said "both", and
///            counted wrong: `Accepted` and `Submitted` had exits, and
///            `Disputed` did not. Its only door was `resolveDispute`, callable
///            by an `immutable` arbiter with no setter — so a lost arbiter key
///            froze every contested escrow forever. That is R1 again, in the
///            contract that was written to fix R1, which is the ordinary way
///            this class of bug survives a rewrite: the fix is applied to the
///            states you were thinking about.
///
///         2. ASSIGNABLE RELEASE. A prime contractor escrows its
///            subcontractors before the parent bounty releases, so it needs
///            working capital against collateral that is already visible
///            on-chain. Visible is not the same as seizable: in V1 the release
///            always paid the worker, so a lender could see the collateral and
///            not attach to it. `assignPayee` makes the assignment irrevocable
///            and public, which is what turns observable into perfected — and
///            it assigns an AMOUNT, not the whole cash flow, so securing a
///            lender does not hand it the worker's margin as well.
///
///         3. NO CHANGE TO WHO JUDGES. Timeouts decide only what happens when
///            nobody acts. They never decide that work was good. Release on
///            merit still requires the requester, and a contested job still
///            requires the arbiter — until DISPUTE_WINDOW passes, after which
///            `resolveDispute` and `expireDispute` are both open and it is
///            first-come-first-served between them. That is not a handover at a
///            fixed moment; it is a second door appearing beside the first.
